abstract: Caused by a politically initiated break in German speaking European countries
  - the so-called Bologna Process - we observe a huge demand for new information systems
  supporting the academic processes of teaching and research. The software qualitatively
  demanded is not available on the market. Some systems are large projects of pilot-systems
  in pioneer universities. Because universities - in contrast to enterprises - have
  little experience in implementing and operating such systems, it seems to be worth
  while to examine the essentials of organizational information systems basic- ally.
  After Lehman's definition of embedded systems 35 years ago, we look at very complex
  systems, embedded into large organizations. The complexity of such system's software
  stems from its database, created and maintained by the the organization's users.
  We argue, from our basic view at original data, which functions are part of the
  core of a campus management system (CaMS) and which are not. E. g. E-learning or
  library do not belong to this core, but need secure and efficient interfaces to
  it. Because CaMS are large and expensive they should be implemented into an organization
  evolutionary.
