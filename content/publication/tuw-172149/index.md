abstract: In recent years, optimization of team performance became a crucial issue
  of the discipline, not only because labor expenses are the highest proportion of
  the costs in software engineering, but also because more and more projects are accomplished
  within small teams. Those teams recruit themselves often out of people who don't
  know each other and therefore have to run through a team building process, in which
  roles and tasks are assigned and clarified. Common approaches to team performance
  optimization try with the help of "role profiles" to achieve role-requirements,
  which must be met by "personal profiles" of the team members. Those "personal profiles"
  are made by mutual skill evaluation within the team and reflect the attitude of
  every person. However, those procedures have the imminent problem of not being usable
  in an early stage of team development, because of their methodical limitations (e.g.
  how can anyone judge someone, if he doesn't know him at all). Optimizing at a beginning
  stage is crucial, because team performance at this point is significantly lower
  than at a later stage. Therefore concepts shall be developed, which support the
  team within the genesis of the group in order to have the optimal role distribution.
  In the best case this is the first meeting. For this reason, the following reports
  analyze teams at their role distribution within the first meeting and at the end
  of the project measuring the quality and contentment with the made decisions. Future
  studies can therefore emerge new and better approaches to team performance optimization
  by using the collected evaluation-data.
