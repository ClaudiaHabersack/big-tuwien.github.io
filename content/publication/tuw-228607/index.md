abstract: The evaluation of an organization's performance may also consider the assessment
  of inter-organizational relationships (IORs). However, the evaluation of IORs is
  typically based on success factors, such as trust, which are difficult to be measured
  quantitatively. In this paper, we present a framework supporting inter-organizational
  performance evaluation which integrates (i) a bottom-up approach supporting the
  identification of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from business information, event
  logs, as well as process models, and (ii) a top-down approach for measuring business
  performance on the strategic level based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method.
  In order to prove the feasibility of the framework, we present an inter-organizational
  performance analysis case study of a beverage manufacturing company. The case study
  shows that the framework enables (i) the derivation of quantifiable KPIs from operational
  data and (ii) the alignment of KPIs with business objectives allowing an evaluation
  of IORs on the strategic level.
