abstract: Business documents exchanged in a service-oriented context play a crucial
  role in the definition of service interfaces. Only if both partners have a common
  agreement on the data exchanged, automated business interactions are possible. The
  United Nations Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT)
  provides a reliable and interoperable solution for conceptual business document
  definitions with UN/CEFACT's Core Components Technical Specification. However, document
  definitions aren't available in a centralized manner to all interested business
  partners. In order to allow for an easy search and retrieval of core component business
  document definitions, a registry is needed. Business partners may retrieve service
  interface definitions from the registry and adapt their software accordingly in
  order to engage in automated business interactions. We specify a registry meta model
  on top of ebRIM, registering core component artifacts and defining their inter-dependencies.
