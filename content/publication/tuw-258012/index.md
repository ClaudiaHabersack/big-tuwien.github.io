abstract: Together with elderly people, a system for the notification of medication
  intake and measuring the blood pressure has been developed. This system consists
  of a hardware part, displaying different visual signals to remind users, and a software
  part to configure the hardware accordingly. Those visual signals are displayed with
  the help of a lamp, which can be placed in the living room or at any other desired
  place. The colors of those signals can be adapted with the help of an application,
  where the time and medication can be configured to be displayed. The developed software
  was created following a user centered design process together with four elderly
  people to get to know their needs and to identify the key requirements for such
  a system.
