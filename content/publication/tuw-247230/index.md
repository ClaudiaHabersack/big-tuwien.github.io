abstract: The German initiative Industry 4.0 will involve amongst other issues networking
  and integration of several different parties (e.g., manufacturing companies, suppliers,
  cus- tomers, sub-contractors) through value networks. This initiative underpins
  that this collaborative partnership will only be feasible if standardization and
  open standards are available. For this purpose a reference architecture is needed
  to provide a technical description of these standards. In this context interoperability
  plays a major role for the seamless exchange of data and information among partners
  in these value networks. Interop- erability involves the interaction of different
  systems and their users. Information modeling is a key concept for providing interoperability.
  In this paper, we present a standards framework that highlights how existing standards
  intertwine to establish value networks in an Industry 4.0 context.
