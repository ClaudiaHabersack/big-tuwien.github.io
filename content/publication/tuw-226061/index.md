abstract: Voice over IP systems are more and more replacing Public Switched Telephone
  Network infrastructures. The number of voice telephony installations and the number
  of Session Initiation Protocol users is constantly increasing. Attacks against Voice
  over IP systems are becoming more imaginative and many attacks can cause financial
  damage, e.g., attackers gain money or create costs for the victim. Therefore, the
  dependency on available and secure Voice over IP systems to conduct secure business
  is given. We provide an environment to uncover real-world toll fraud attacks by
  collecting data using a Voice over IP honeynet solution.
