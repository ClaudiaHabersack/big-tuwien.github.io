abstract: Advances in technology have led to an increased presence  of multi-touch
  interfaces in consumer products in recent  years. Still, many challenges remain
  that designers need to  face when designing for multi-touch interaction. As multi-  touch
  interfaces are becoming more ubiquitous it is  important to investigate not only
  their performance for  certain tasks, but also the user experience of interacting  with
  such interfaces. In this paper we discuss eight  challenges that need to be considered
  when designing the  user experience of multi-touch interfaces. The challenges  also
  reveal potential areas for future research in the field of  multi-touch interaction.
