abstract: 'Software interrelationships, like software dependencies, have impact on
  the quality and evolution of software projects and are therefore important to software
  development and maintenance. Sophisticated systems have been created in the past
  to define, manage, and utilize relationships in software processes. Mentionable
  examples for this are package management systems of Linux distributions and build
  systems like Apache Maven. These systems are clustered in software-ecosystems, which
  most of the times are syntactically and semantically incompatible to each other,
  although the described software can overlap. Currently there are no viable systems
  for querying information across different ecosystems. This thesis is about how to
  overcome semantic and syntactic borders of software ecosystems and thereby enable
  practical usage of information about software interrelationships in software development
  and maintenance. An iterative approach was used to develop a prototype, which enables
  integration of - and therefore queries across - different software ecosystems. Particular
  emphasis was placed on the extendibility and the scalability, i.e., to be able to
  easily integrate new and many ecosystems. During development, Semantic Web technologies
  showed to provide a suitable framework to approach this task. Several ecosystems,
  like Debian/Ubuntu repositories, and CVEs and CPEs defined by the NIST, were used
  to evaluate data integration. Additionally small applications, like a vulnerability
  notification system and license violation detector were used to show the usefulness
  of aggregated cross-ecosystem-interrelationships. Contributions of this thesis consist
  of: a distributed architecture for data retrieval, parsing, mapping, post-processing
  and querying of generic data into semantic RDF data model; an abstract owl-ontology
  for semantic modeling of inter-software relationships; and a model for processing
  temporally scoped RDF statements using SPARQL without previous normalization of
  observation times to time periods.'
