abstract: This work presents a tool-based approach for making the concept of Java
  internationalization more convenient for practical development projects. Internationalization
  denotes a pervasive programming approach for building multilingual applications
  efficiently. However, dramatically often, the expected advantages get lost. Reasons
  for this fact are a lack of understanding of cultural, geographical and political
  differences as well as a missing overview of the concepts provided in the Java programming
  language. In addition, once a product is fully internationalized, it becomes tedious
  for developers to keep all the language-specific artifacts up to date and consistent.
  The theoretical part of this work addresses the topic of software internationalization
  and localization. Based on analyzing the state-of-the-art of Java internationalization
  and typical problems occurring in practice, the practical part focuses on the implementation
  of development tools for supporting the internationalization of software-artifacts.
  For assisting engineers in the day-to-day development work, the presented tooling
  is integrated into one of the most widely used open source development platforms
  for Java. The created reference implementation is named TapiJI (Tooling for agile
  and process integrated Java Internationalization) and can be seamlessly integrated
  into existing development processes. With the use of context-sensitive as well as
  general helps, which represent internationalization tasks transparent, TapiJI reduces
  both the effort and the problems due to improper handling of internationalization.
  Even engineers with little experience in writing multilingual applications are permanently
  advised to ensure high and uniform code quality. The resulting tool suite is successfully
  presented in special-interest magazines, published for free usage and receives a
  wide acceptance in the open source community.
