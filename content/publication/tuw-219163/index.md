abstract: Standardized business documents are a prerequisite for successful information
  exchange in electronic business transactions. The United Nations Centre for Trade
  Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) provides a conceptual modeling approach,
  called Core Components, used by Business Partners (BPs) for defining business document
  models (BDMs). BDMs are essential for defining service interfaces in service-oriented
  systems. However, in such a highly dynamic environment with ever-changing market
  demands, BPs are confronted with the need to revise their BDMs resulting in a multitude
  of different versions. BPs may dictate the use of new versions of BDMs, but small-
  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may not always adopt new BDM versions due to
  the cost and effort involved, inhibiting automated electronic information exchange.
  In this article, we propose a framework including (i) a classification of the impact
  of changes in BDMs, (ii) evolution templates for the automated transformation of
  business documents between different BDM versions, and (iii) mitigation strategies
  for evolutions where fully-automated and semantic-preserving transformations are
  not feasible. Having such a framework at hand provides SMEs with a low-cost and
  light-weight approach for dealing with evolving market requirements and hence evolving
  business documents. Finally, we analyze the evolution of UN/CEFACT's Cross Industry
  Invoice which has been mandated to be used for electronic invoicing within the European
  Union as well as present a critical discussion of the evolution templates defined.
