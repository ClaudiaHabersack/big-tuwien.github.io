abstract: Business partners willing to do business electronically<br> with each other
  must reach an agreement (1) on the economic<br> level, (2) on the inter-organizational
  process choreography,<br> and (3) on the services implementing the choreography.<br>
  In order to search for a potential business partner,<br> one will first look for
  a partner who offers a required<br> service on the economic level and who supports
  a complementary<br> role in a choreography, before binding to its IT services.<br>
  Inasmuch, a registry for inter-organizational systems<br> should cover all three
  levels and maintain the dependencies<br> between them. In this paper we set up on
  well accepted approaches<br> on the different levels, i.e. (1) the e3value ontology,<br>
  (2) the UN/CEFACT modeling methodology (UMM),<br> and (3) the business process execution
  language (BPEL).<br> We specify a registry meta model on top of ebRIM registering<br>
  the artifacts on the different levels and defining their<br> inter-dependencies.
