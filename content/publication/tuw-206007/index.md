abstract: The basic aim of this work was the design and implementation of a medical
  health care application for a Hospital Information System (HIS) based on the Open
  Electronic Health Record (openEHR) standard, which extends an existing integration
  architecture for openEHR and enriched this with additional functionality. In the
  area of a HIS many different individual systems are used to help and support physicians
  and health care personnel during their work in a hospital. One important component
  of a HIS is a centralized stored and maintained Electronic Health Record (EHR).
  There are many different standards available for electronic health records, having
  different approaches in how to store and visualize medical data. In the course of
  this work the most common and widespread standards and their characteristics are
  discussed and compared. A patient synchronized application responsible for the dynamic
  visualization of the medical data coming from the openEHR based back-end was developed
  as part of this work. The implementation focused the design of a component capable
  of dynamically rendering archetype based health care records defined in the openEHR
  standard. Furthermore, additional services to the existing integration architecture
  were introduced to prototype e.g. anonymization components for medical data, system
  independent interfaces for patient synchronized applications and a Patient Master
  Index (PMI). The developed front-end for maintaining medical data implements most
  of the defined and necessary visual input elements of the openEHR standard and supports
  the visualization of so called Operational Templates (OPT). The service oriented
  architecture is capable of maintaining and processing patient synchronized application
  context data within a HIS in a system independent manner and assists the integration
  of web based, Intra- and Internet based solutions for medical health care applications.
  The dynamic visualization of archetype based electronic health records can be achieved
  using the introduced front-end and patient synchronized applications can be integrated
  into existing HIS environments. Although the use of archetype based electronic patient
  records raises the complexity of the individual developed systems it has main advantages
  such as flexibility and therefore justifies their application.
