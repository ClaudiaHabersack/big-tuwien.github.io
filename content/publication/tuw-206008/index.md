abstract: Software testing is needed to assure quality of software, especially security.
  Lots of automated tools exist to ease the work of testers to find security vulnerabilities
  but there is no guide how to evaluate and select an appropriate tool. Every tool
  is supporting different features by which a random choice might not represent the
  most fitting tool for the software to test. Therefore, a kind of measurement to
  ease the selection is needed. In this thesis, evaluation criteria were defined which
  are based on common criteria published in scientific papers. On the basis of this,
  an evaluation process is worked out to support testers to find an optimal testing
  tool. The design of the process guarantees short training periods for the tester.
  The focus is on security testing tools which are specialised in fuzz testing. Fuzz
  testing uses invalid or wrong input to cause wrong behaviour or a crash of the application
  in order to reveal security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a huge amount of random
  data is produced and needed for executing fuzz testing. In most cases the generation
  of input data is done automatically by tools. Automation is an important requirement
  as tools shall be able to create and execute test cases as well as compare results
  autonomous. The criteria are described in detail so that they are comprehensible.
  In addition, for each criterion a statement how to verify its fulfillment is given.
  The solution is also checked out practically on the basis of four security testing
  tools to show how the process works. The practical part is done on Windows XP Professional.
  With the described evaluation criteria, every tester should be in the position to
  elect a suitable testing tool for successful security testing. Besides, the conducted
  evaluation shows that none of the selected tools is completely automated as manual
  input is needed to compare test results.
