abstract: For enterprises nowadays it is - in the rising price fight of products and
  services - increasingly more difficult to set themselves apart from competitors
  and to assert themselves in their efforts towards the customer. One possibility
  of differentiating oneself from competitors is the employment of a comprehensive
  enterprise strategy, which puts the focus of all sales oriented business activities
  on the customer and the customer relationship. This enterprise strategy implies
  the institution of a customer relations management, the so-called "Customer Relationship
  Management" (CRM), which is understood as an enterprise-wide, IT based principle
  of organization and direction. Hence, for more and more of the mainly small- and
  middle-sized Austrian enterprises the introduction of a comprehensive and inexpensive
  "Customer Relationship Management" system as supporting instrument within the process
  of customer acquisition and long-term retention gains increasing importance. At
  the same time offerers of open source software, since open source products have
  crucially widened their importance within the server area over the years, intensely
  try to strengthen their presence in the so far nearly exclusively by closed source
  offerers occupied area of business applications. The present thesis, thus, concentrates
  on the question of to what extent an open source CRM product can claim and sustain
  its position in Microsoft environments of small and middle enterprises (SME) as
  cost-saving and, above all, serious alternative to commercial closed source CRM
  products, regarding covered CRM areas, functionality and interaction with existing
  system and application components. In absence of suitable ready-made comparison
  instruments from technical literature the development of a general matrix of requirements
  to CRM software for SME and a derived, product-independent rating grid for CRM software
  products represents one of the two main goals of this work. The rating of the two
  CRM applications, vtiger CRM 5.0.3 (open source) and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0
  (closed source), representatively chosen from each offerer area constitutes the
  second main goal and is - based on the developed comparison tool set - being accomplished
  independently by use of a practice test with following comparison of the individual
  rating results.
