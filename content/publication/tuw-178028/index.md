abstract: Approximately 1000 students of computer science and business informatics
  attend the course Introduction to Object- Oriented Modeling (OOM) offered by the
  Business Informatics Group (BIG) of the Vienna University of Technology each year
  in order to learn the basic concepts of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and
  to obtain a certificate. For finishing the course successfully, the students must
  pass three small tests where they have to prove their theoretical knowledge about
  UML concepts as well as their ability to apply this knowledge in practical exercises.
  In this paper we report our experiences in assessing the modeling knowledge of our
  students and we reveal how we design the tests.
