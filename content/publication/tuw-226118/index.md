abstract: Due to the increased complexity of today's software systems, the attack
  surface and the likelihood of attacks increase. Security testing is an important
  task needed for developing robust and secure systems. At the same time, security
  testing is expensive because it is difficult to detect security failures and to
  decide if an observed behavior during security testing is indeed a security failure.
  To meet security requirements in IT infrastructures, a security engineering process
  has to be established. One crucial factor contributing to a higher level of security
  is to establish security tests. For detecting vulnerabilities two aspects are important
  for security tests. First, the failure has to be triggered by conducting simulated
  attacks at the interfaces of the specific software. Additionally, the behavior has
  to be determined as misbehavior. Our approach uses XML and XML schema definition
  as a common data format for describing different attack vectors in addition to a
  single generic algorithm in order to generate security-relevant test data to simulate
  attacks against the system under test. A common data format as the basis for describing
  test data and security attacks as well as transformations to support various formats
  ensures that the implementation of the generation logic for security test data is
  only needed once. To detect errors, we observe the behavior of the system under
  test and introduce machine learning methods based on derived metrics from the behavior
  as a generic method for different test targets which improves the accuracy of the
  security test result of the automated security testing approach. Security tests
  can uncover security failures which increases the quality of the software. A proper
  determination of security failures raises the acceptance of the method during the
  development lifecycle and the automation additionally reduces costs. Increasing
  the level of security and meeting the security requirements of software projects
  ensures protecting valuable systems and information against attackers.
