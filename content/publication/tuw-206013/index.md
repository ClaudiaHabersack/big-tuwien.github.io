abstract: Window manager have been an integral part of our daily interactions with
  computers for  the last three decades. The underlying concept, the desktop metaphor,
  dates back even  further. Employing visualization, interaction, and management techniques
  window  managers simplify the handling of the everyday user processes across professions.  However
  little is still known regarding user satisfaction with and potential problems of  window
  managers. Developing evidence-based insight into this realm is essential for  improving
  the usability of window-based computer interfaces as they directly affect the  daily
  life of the end user.  The thesis focuses on the technical challenges for users
  in the everyday work  environments when interacting with window managers and their
  applications. More  specifically this research investigates aspects of multi-monitoring
  and task management  as they offer promising opportunities for improving the way
  users currently interact  with window managers.  The thesis presents an analysis
  of related work that proposes new prototypes and  techniques to determine whether
  the presented enhancements are addressing the end  user's needs and benefits. This
  analysis led to the development of sixteen hypotheses  regarding the way users interact
  with window managers, and their practices regarding  task management and multi-monitoring.
  To verify the hypotheses an online survey was  designed and implemented yielding
  responses from 73 participants. The results of the  survey were compared with the
  results of previous studies and technical prototypes.  The most significant findings
  were identified in the areas of navigation, window  organization and sequence, interaction
  between windows, task management,  multitasking and multi-monitoring.
