abstract: In the context of smart factories, a seamless information exchange between
  information systems on the same layer (horizontal integration) and between information
  system son different layers (vertical integration) is a key issue. For this purpose
  we aim for an integrated modeling framework spanning over production chains and
  value networks. In building this framework, we first concentrate on the layers realizing
  the business functions and the manufacturing control functions. Thereby, we build
  up on the Resource Event Agent (REA)business ontology (ISO/IEC 15944-4) to describe
  external activities requiring horizontal integration with business partners and
  internal activities serving as a hook for vertical integration within a manufacturing
  enterprise. Furthermore, we base our framework on the ISA-95 industry standard (ANSI/ISA-95,
  IEC62264) to describe the vertical integration within an enterprise. In this paper,
  we demonstrate how information given in REA models is transformed to corresponding
  ISA-95 skeletons. In other words, we show how a model describing the main business
  functions of an enterprise is used to derive essential concepts relevant to the
  manufacturing execution system.
