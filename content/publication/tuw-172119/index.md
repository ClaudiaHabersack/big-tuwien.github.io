abstract: Issue Tracking is understood as an integral part of project management where
  you have to track project relevant matters. These issues can have an influence on
  the progress of the ongoing project and so they have to be kept in mind. This thesis
  tries to figure out how Issue Tracking can be implemented by using email. The results
  serve as an input for the design and development of a mailbased Issue Tracking system.
  Nowadays email is a frequently used communication medium. There is a growing need
  to use email also in further application areas, for example for scheduling, taskmanagement
  activities, archiving and Issue Tracking. There are two reasons why these needs
  cannot be fully met. First the email standard has marginal changed within the last
  20 years and second the mailclients´ features lag behind these upcoming consumer
  needs. This document tries to reveal the requirements of mailclients in order to
  support mailbased Issue Tracking. The presented solution introduces hierarchical
  arranged tags to mark sent as well as incoming emails. This means that you can characterize
  an email with one or even more tags, which makes you much more flexible than using
  the standard folder structure. The implementation of the solution is based on the
  Opensource email client "Mozilla Thunderbird". This extension is explained in detail
  at the end of this thesis.
