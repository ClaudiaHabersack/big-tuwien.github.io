abstract: The REA business model language is an established vehicle (i) to model businesses
  in terms of domain specific value chains and their key concepts and (ii) to capture
  business data in terms of accounting artefacts. REA has evolved into a specification
  that could drive web shops, enterprise/trading information systems, enterprise resource
  planning systems, etc. Such systems require support for sophisticated business rules
  in order to decouple business logic from application logic. In this work we present
  a framework for structural integration of business rules into REA business models.
