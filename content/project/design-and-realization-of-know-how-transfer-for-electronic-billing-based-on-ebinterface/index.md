### Topic

The definition of the Austrian e-Billing Standard ebInterface was successfully conducted by well-known ERP system vendors under the lead ot the TU Vienna. The project ebInvoice resulted in the implementation of the ebInterface standard in their ERP systems. A success of the ebInterface standard requires a wide-spread adoption by potential users of the ERP systems. In order to stimulate the adoption the ebTransfer project will design and realize an know-how transfer on ebInterface to consultants and multipliers.
