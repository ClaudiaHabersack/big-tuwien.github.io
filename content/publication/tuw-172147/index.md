abstract: Software visualization aims to help people understand computer software.
  This thesis utilizes visualization techniques to examine the co-evolution of production
  classes and automated test cases to provide insights into the test process of the
  software under inspection. Nine popular open source projects are selected from a
  pool of several thousands according to their appropriateness for the chosen visualization
  approach. The software used is adapted to the needs of the study. It employs repository
  mining (i.e., exploration of a projectÂ´s versioning system) and size metrics to
  generate the visual depictions needed for the observation of different co-evolution
  scenarios. The interpretation of the results provides various views on the testing
  processes being followed suitable for further test planning.
