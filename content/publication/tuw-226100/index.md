abstract: Code reviews are a very effective, but effortful quality assurance technique.
  A major problem is to read and understand source-code that was produced by someone
  else. With different programming styles and complex interactions, understanding
  the code under review is the most expensive sub-task of a code review. As with many
  other modern software engineering practices, code reviews may be applied as a continuous
  process to reduce the effort and support the concept of collective ownership. This
  study evaluates the effect of a continuous code review process on the understandability
  and collective ownership of the code base. A group of 8 subjects performed a total
  of 114 code reviews within 18 months in an industrial context and conducted an expert
  evaluation according to this research question. This study concludes that there
  is a clear positive effect on the understandability and collective ownership of
  the code base with continuous code reviews, but also limiting factors and drawbacks
  for complex review tasks.
