abstract: XML has replaced traditional EDI standards in the field of business document
  standardization. Despite of the syntax, the principal approach to develop business
  document standards has not changed. A standardized business document is built by
  a superset of all elements that may appear in any business context, leading to overloaded
  and complex standards. However, in a particular partnership only a small percentage
  of the elements is used. This results in a top-down approach starting from a generic
  document and specifying partner-specific subsets. Such an approach is too costly
  for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), because agreements on subsets must
  be implemented in their software systems. As an alternative we suggest a bottom-up
  solution that starts from a core set of elements, representing the intersection
  of all industry contexts. Thereby, the core set may be extended to incorporate the
  needs of a specific business context. In this paper we examine different mechanisms
  provided by XML Schema to realize such an extension. The applicability of the different
  mechanisms is evaluated by means of the Austrian e-Invoicing standard ebInterface,
  which we co-authored.
