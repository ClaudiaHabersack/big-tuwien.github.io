The manufacturing processes of the future need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer 
demands for, e.g., large series production, mass customization, or changing orders. The organisations are also 
changing and manufacturing companies are not only part of sequential, long-term supply chains, but also part of 
(potentially) extensive manufacturing networks which require agile collaboration between partners. Companies 
involved in such networks need to be able to design, configure, execute, and monitor a very large number of 
manufacturing process instances, each representing a different order and supply chain instance. One way to 
achieve this is the establishment of virtual factories through a middleware platform.

Finding the right business partners to carry out manufacturing processes is naturally a prerequisite for this. 
Apart from costs, other factors like trust, reliability and availability play a role during the formation of dynamic 
production networks â€“ both during design time and runtime of such a network. Hence, in this project, the formation of 
dynamic production networks will be supported both on the conceptual as well as on the technical level.
