abstract: Smart production systems need to be able to adapt to changing environments
  and market needs. They have to reflect changes in (i) the reconfiguration of the
  production systems themselves, (ii) the processes they perform or (iii) the products
  they produce. Manual intervention for system adaptation is costly and potentially
  error-prone. In this article, we propose a model-driven approach for the automatic
  generation and regeneration of production plans that can be triggered anytime a
  change in any of the three aforementioned parameters occurs.
