abstract: The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) refers to a distributed network of physical
  objects and applications that create, transform and consume data. Due to the growing
  interest in digital transformation and Industry 4.0 topics, IoT is becoming more
  and more important. However, in order to correctly implement IoT concepts that are
  mostly highly complex, solutions and techniques must be provided to tackle a multitude
  of challenges such as heterogeneity, collaborative development, reusability of software
  artifacts, self-adaptation, etc. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) uses the abstraction
  power of models to handle the complexity of systems and thus it may act as a key-enabler
  for IoT systems and applications. Therefore, we present an initial mapping study
  on the state-of-the-art in the field of MDE4IoT. This study aims to identify to
  which extent MDE techniques are currently being applied in the field of IoT, and
  which challenges are addressed.
