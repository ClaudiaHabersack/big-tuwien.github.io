abstract: People suffer from different injuries throughout their lifes. To prohibit
  some deseases, prevention is also an important factor for staying healthy. Some
  of the suffered injuries or other diseases require to conduct rehabiliation and
  do some specific exercises. Those exercises can be boring and some people suffer
  from a motivation loss, which leads to a rehabiliation non-complience and therefore
  in a bad result or in the worst case in not regaining one&iquest;s health. The usage
  of serious games and exergames - which include exercises combined with different
  video games and fun or motivating aspects - have been increasing in these areas
  in the last years. This thesis presents some innovative and new serious games, which
  were developed together with different stakeholders in the scope of rehabilitation
  and prevention. One serious game supports people suffering from a stroke, developed
  for the Wii Fit Balance Board, a device for capturing the weight shift, by letting
  them play in a maze game. Another serious game focuses on wrist rehabiliation by
  using a mobile phone, to do different exercises, which allows patients to interact
  with a game by capturing their movement with the integrated sensors. The third game
  was developed to support people suffering from a traumatic brain injury. This serious
  game helps them to regain mental abilities by delivering different tasks within
  a game, which needs to be done by the patient in the correct order. The last developed
  game tries to support people in preventing them from getting sick. This application
  rewards people for doing sports with specific benefits within an integrated game.
  Based on those serious games, different requirements were extracted and used for
  different use-cases to create a architecture of an so called rehabiliation eco-system.
  The overall goal of this system was to bring different serious games together into
  one system, which should also contain different other applications like Personal
  Health Record functionalities. Based on the different factors and foundations, explained
  for such a system, a prototype was implemented. This prototype should also serve
  as a basis for further other applications and games, which are planned to be integrated
  there as well. This system can support patients and other stakeholders in their
  rehabiliation and prevention process, and deliver innovative ways of doing so.
