abstract: In order to achieve higher utilisation rates for the material excavated
  from underground construction sites, one of the main objectives is efficient, digital
  processing of available data on material, mass and time parameters for the mined
  rock. Selected information needs to be made available to a wide audience at the
  same time. This initiates a value chain, which goes far beyond the construction
  industry and enables successful upcycling. The evolving software MineralBay is committed
  to this goal by using the internet to bring together owners or suppliers of mineral
  resources with customers easily, quickly and at any time to facilitate the exchange
  and trading of raw materials. MineralBay is a management and merchandising system
  for excavated material, whose speciality is access to and processing of real-time
  data, e.g. in the form of online material analysis results from tunnel boring machines.
  The information obtained is used for quality management of already placed excavation
  material and for gapless documentation of the material flow from the beginning to
  the end of the construction project.
