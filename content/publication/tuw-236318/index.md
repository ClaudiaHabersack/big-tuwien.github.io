abstract: The procedure of software testing and quality management is an essential
  part of today s software development process and contributes to the success of a
  project. Due to the volatility of components, requirements and in particular user
  interfaces, testing these elements becomes more complex and time-consuming. Especially
  modifications of the user interface may affect the consistency of test cases and
  test scripts, as they are highly dependent on the user interfaces elements. To overcome
  this problem, a model-based approach, where a model represents an element of the
  user interface, could be helpful. In the context of this thesis a model based approach
  for user interface testing is planned and implemented. The application eases the
  specification of test cases and supports the user during the creation of functional
  tests without the requirement of any programming skills. The usage of the prototype
  enables the definition of test cases in relation to a model referring to the user
  interface. Furthermore, the user is able to export the defined test cases and integrate
  them into an established test process. The initial chapters of this thesis provide
  a short overview on the required fundamentals. The succeeding chapters are split
  into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part consists of the planning
  and analysis of the concept, requirements and the architecture as well as a heuristic
  evaluation of sketches of the user interface. The practical part provides explanations
  and representations about the implementation of the project. This thesis results
  in an executable prototype of an application for a model based approach for user
  interface tests. A typical user should provide a model representation of a website
  as input for the application. Afterwards one can define concrete procedures for
  test cases and generate the defined procedures as test cases for either the JUnit
  or TestNG Testframework.
