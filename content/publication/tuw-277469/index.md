abstract: 'Kanban refers and relates to the concepts and ideas of Lean Manufacturing
  originating from developments in the Japanese automobile industry following the
  Second World War. When applied to software development, Kanban theory promotes efficient
  software development systems through the use of planned, lean workflows that improve
  efficiency and avoid waste. Although Kanban was initially developed and used within
  distributed teams, correlating research is lacking, incomplete and relatively young
  as a research field. Current work in the field of Distributed Teams as a trend in
  software development emerged parallel to the development of Kanban throughout the
  2000´s. This thesis addresses the need for research in this field and investigates
  three specific aspects of Kanban in a distributed team, these being: Pull System,
  Work-In-Progress-Limit (WIP-Limit) and the concept of Kaizen Culture (continuous
  improvement) within the field of software development. The focus of this work is
  to investigate how making occurring challenges more apparent and provide possible
  solutions to those challenges. This is wide and multi-faceted in its scope and in
  order to provide focus, this work is reduced to the three above aspects as well
  as the distribution, size and life cycle of the distributed team. The qualitative
  methodology of this thesis is based on a case study where empirical data was collected
  through the use of semi-structured interviews with experts and executive employees
  who were familiar in using Kanban within their distributed teams. The evaluative
  strategy employed used qualitative content analysis as this was most appropriate
  to the aims of the study. The results of this study show that challenges and complications
  result from the use of Kanban, it is shown to be effective within distributed teams.
  The primary challenge for the use of the Pull System aspect is the availability
  and flow of information relevant to the development work. The challenge to use the
  WIP-Limit is in the clear distinguishing of the workflow steps to be meaningfully
  limited as well as in how they effectively correlated to the composition of the
  team and the working practices in use. For Kaizen-Culture, facilitating a working
  atmosphere that promotes efficient and open communication as well as the establishment
  of trust between team members is a crucial challenge for cultivating a culture of
  continuous improvement. These challenges are discussed in detail in this thesis,
  and it concludes with eight recommendations for practising Kanban in a distributed
  team that is derived from the empirical data collected through this research.'
