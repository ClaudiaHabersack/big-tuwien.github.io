abstract: 'Legal Informatics is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous scientific domain.  Especially
  in the field of legal software engineering there is a growing need  to develop systems
  that aim at facilitating the retrieval process for users who  work in legal disciplines.
  The change of media toward web-based legal  document retrieval systems and the increasing
  number of users in this area  create new requirements for user interface design,
  legal document visualization and  optimum support for search and retrieval processes
  in order to find relevant legal content.  Thus this thesis discusses user-centered
  visualization aspects for web-based  legal document retrieval systems with a strong
  focus on the conception and  implementation of the "LawSlider", an innovative tool
  for temporal and spatial interaction, navigation and representation of legal documents.
  The exemplary realization of  the "LawSlider" within a comprehensive design study
  for the legal  document retrieval system "SozDok-Neu" emphasizes its practical  and
  universal applicability for the legal domain.  Hypotheses and conceptual solution
  approaches for current and envisioned issues on structure and link realization within
  legal documents outline the technical aspect of this thesis. '
