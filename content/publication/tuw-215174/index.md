abstract: A commit message is a description of a change in a Version Control System
  (VCS). Besides the actual description of the change, it can also serve as an indicator
  for the purpose of the change, e.g. a change to refactor code might be accompanied
  by a commit message in the form of "Refactored class XY to improve readability".
  We would label the change in our example a perfective change, according to maintenance
  literature. This simplified example shows how it is possible to classify a change
  by its commit message. However, commit messages are unstructured, textual data and
  efforts to automatically label changes into categories like perfective have only
  been applied to a small set of projects within the same company or the same community.
  In this work, we present a cross-project evaluated and valid mapping of changes
  to the code base and their purpose that is usable without any customization on any
  open-source project. We provide further the Eclipse Plug-In Subcat which allows
  for a comfortable analysis of projects from within Eclipse. By using Subcat, we
  are able to automatically assess if a commit to the code was e.g. a bug fix or a
  refactoring. This information is very useful for e.g. developer profiling or locating
  bad smells in modules.
