abstract: Quality function deployment (QFD) is a method for quality assurance developed
  for application in production processes. One prominent tool for implementing QFD
  is the House of Quality (HoQ), whose basic design principles have been left unchanged
  for the last decades. Modern concepts for handling product variability, most notably
  feature models, represent intuitive means for a refurbished roof construction of
  the HoQ, and thus more expressiveness in the definition of functional requirements.
