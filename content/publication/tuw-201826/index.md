  provides the Core Components approach for defining standard business document types
  based on all-embracing, reusable building blocks. For utilizing standard business
  document types in concrete business scenarios, these standard business document
  types need customizing resulting in business document type variants. However, the
  current approach is missing sufficient mechanisms for managing the resulting variants.
  First, customizing standard business document types is currently based on a textual
  specification only. Hence, variability within business document types is missing
  an explicit representation. Second, supporting the process of customizing standard
  business document types requires dedicated tool-support. In this paper, we formalize
  variability within the Core Components approach by adopting concepts from variability
  management and introduce a declarative approach based on variability models for
  validating the process of business document type customization. Furthermore, we
  present an evaluation of the approach proposed by means of a feasibility study.
  The approach provides a generic method for validating customized standard business
  document types.
