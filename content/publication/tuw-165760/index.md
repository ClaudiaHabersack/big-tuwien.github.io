abstract: Business partners willing to do business electronically with each other
  must reach an agreement (1) on the economic level, (2) on the inter-organizational
  process choreography, and (3) on the services implementing the choreography. In
  order to search for a potential business partner, one will first look for a partner
  who offers a required service on the economic level and who supports a complementary
  role in a choreography, before binding to its IT services. Inasmuch, a registry
  for inter-organizational systems should cover all three levels and maintain the
  dependencies between them. In this paper we set up on well accepted approaches on
  the different levels, i.e. (1) the e3value ontology, (2) the UN/CEFACT modeling
  methodology (UMM), and (3) the business process execution language (BPEL). We specify
  a registry meta model on top of ebRIM registering the artifacts on the different
  levels and defining their inter-dependencies.
