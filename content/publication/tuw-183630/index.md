abstract: Interoperability issues between di&#64256;erent implementations in  large-scale
  systems is one of the major reasons for increased e&#64256;ort during  system test.
  This paper addresses this problem in the context of the Online Certi&#64257;cate
  Status Protocol (OCSP) in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is part of the
  certi&#64257;cate veri&#64257;cation process of many components. The high interconnection
  of OCSP clients and server increases the complexity of system tests to ensure interoperation.
  This paper pro-  vides a component based testing method for clients and servers
  using OCSP exempli&#64257;ed by testing PKI components of a nationwide IT infrastructure.
  The method ensures high interoperability requirements of large-scale infrastructures
  during component tests and reduces e&#64256;orts for test execution.
