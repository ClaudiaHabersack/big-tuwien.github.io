abstract: Driven by the fast evolution of the internet, innovative technologies and
  web services, the user changed from a passive information consumer to an active
  content distributor within the whole web sphere. The buzzword web 2.0 became a synonym
  for this evolution which has enormously increased communication possibilities among
  people by enabling them to stay in touch via communities, blogs and social networks.
  In the same way B2C and C2C e-commerce rapidly changed within the last years. Users
  were integrated into existing online shops and mutated from a simple buyer to a
  fully integrated customer. Thus, a modern shop visitor can recommend products, leave
  comments, rate vendors or publish wish lists. This recent phenomenon, called social
  commerce or social shopping, leads to more customer satisfaction, loyalty and consequently
  to more revenue for the vendor. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for innovative
  e-commerce models and new shopping functionalities. Currently, only few vendors
  succeeded to launch new platforms and services,but market researchers confirm the
  economically expanding value of innovative user driven e-commerce solutions. In
  the near future, social shopping features might become a must-have for every modern
  shop owner. This paper presents the results of an extended case study research on
  future B2C and C2C e-commerce models. As a main focus, the key features as well
  as current trends of social commerce are identified and analyzed in detail. For
  successful next generation shopping, the presented trend-setting movements have
  to be integrated in new e-shops and platforms to meet the demands of modern customers.
