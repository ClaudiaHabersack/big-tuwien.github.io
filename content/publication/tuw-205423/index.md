abstract: Voice over IP (VoIP) is in wide use today, replacing  phone lines in many
  scenarios. However, often, security  isnÂ´t considered well enough, even though many
  security  attacks are already known. More research on VoIP security  is needed to
  enhance the level of security of VoIP systems  and to show the implications of failing
  to take appropriate  security measures. This paper presents a short introduc-  tion
  in testing VoIP components, proposes an architecture  and implementation of a robust,
  flexible and efficient VoIP  test environment for security related tests. Experiences
  us-  ing the implemented environment for different VoIP security  tests are shown
  to demonstrate the suitability of the pro-  posed test environment for research
  and teaching purposes
