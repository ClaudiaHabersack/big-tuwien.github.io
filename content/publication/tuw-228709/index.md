abstract: Over the past few decades, the internet has grown to an enormous infrastructure
  connecting millions of people world-wide. The large scale of the internet has offered
  unique economic opportunities by enabling the ability to reach a tremendous, global
  user base for businesses and individuals alike. The great success and opportunities
  also open up overwhelming challenges due to the drastic growth and increasing complexity
  of the internet in the last decade. The main challenge for development and operations
  is to provide reliable and fast service, despite of fast growth in both traffic
  and frequency of requests. When it comes to speed, internet users have high demands
  on the performance of online services. Recent research has shown that 47% of online
  consumers expect load times of two seconds or less. This puts high pressure on web
  applications and websites in terms of performance and reliability, when even minor
  changes in performance can have significant effects on how users perceive an application
  and decide whether or not to continue with their interaction. If the revenue of
  a business is generated through their online presence, performance directly correlates
  with loss of sales, and damage of brand perception. With the growth of the internet
  and its user base, the underlying infrastructure has drastically transformed from
  single server systems to heterogeneous, distributed systems. Thus, the end performance
  depends on diverse factors in different levels of server systems, networks and infrastructure,
  which makes providing a satisfying end-user experience and QoS a challenge for large
  scale internet applications. In this thesis, statistical methods are applied to
  deal with the management of web performance issues. In order to properly manage
  performance, the timely observation and analysis of performance degradation is of
  key importance. Statistical changepoint analysis and exploratory visual analysis
  are applied to results obtained through synthetic monitoring of a simulation system
  to identify and discuss how performance issues in web applications can be detected.
  Web Performance Benchmarking of competitors is discussed as a way to establish a
  baseline for an overall performance goal. A general methodology for web performance
  benchmarking is developed based on statistical analysis of finite collections of
  observed data from production systems. The presented approach is then applied in
  a case study for benchmarking search engine providers.
