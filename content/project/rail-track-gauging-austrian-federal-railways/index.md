### Topic

The project SWITCH09 aims at capturing the processes of rail track gauging at the Austrian Federal Railways in a formalized manner. The captured process model facilitates the communication of existing processes between different departments and may be used to detect bottle-necks in the current process flow. The rail track gauging process detects damaged parts of railway tracks and railway track switches in particular. The repair process of the damaged track parts is currently done manually. With the investment in a new maintenance machine the repair process will be done in a semi-automatic manner in the future. Apart from capturing the actual process, the process to-be under consideration of the new maintenance machine shall be captured as well.
