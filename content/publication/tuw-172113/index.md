abstract: Today the importance of Information Technology is often rated in a wrong
  way. Strategical advantages through efficient use are often not considered. In the
  case of breakdown of the IT, the company notices the consequences of missing preventive
  measures. This situation, and in addition to the fact that many companies do not
  have any preventive measures, was the main motive for this elaboration. This elaboration
  includes the methods Business Continuity Management and IT-Service Continuity. Business
  Continuity Management is process-orientated which means, that business-processes
  with the highest impact in the case of breakdown of the IT are classified as sensitive.
  IT-Service continuity includes methods for securing continuity of IT-services of
  a company. These measures are discribed by the method Disaster Recovery. In the
  following there is a description of possibilites to improve IT-services of a company
  in an efficient way. These methods are described by the current issue of ITIL v3
  Continual Service Improvement. In this elaboration there is a practical experience
  through the appliance of emergency-methods for two companies. In this chapter there
  are proposals for measures to establish or to improve emergency-plans. These proposals
  are made considering the properties of the companies. For the smaller company there
  is a recommendation for IT-Service Continuity through Disaster Recovery. For the
  bigger company methods of Business Continuity Management are recommended and described.
  For bigger companies additionally a description of possibilities to improve the
  IT-services through methods of Continual Service Improvement is derived.
