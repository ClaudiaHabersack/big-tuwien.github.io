abstract: 'In today´s software engineering world, a multitude of various tools is
  used: Version Control, Issue-Tracker as well as Continuous-Integration-Software
  are usually the backbone of professional software projects. These tools generate
  vast amounts of data over the project lifecycle, which could potentially aid the
  decision-making of relevant project personnel. There exist several visualization
  tools that aim to satisfy these information needs, however, they typically only
  ever use one of the aforementioned data sources. Combining and cross-referencing
  data from these sources could uncover interesting connections and lead to better
  decision-making. This master´s thesis presents a tool that generates interactive,
  time-based visualizations from Version Control-, Issue Tracker- and CI-Data: ZIVSED
  (Zoomable Interactive Visualizations of Soft- ware Engineering Data). The thesis
  deals with the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation of the tool. Using
  a requirements-analysis, the document first establishes the information needs of
  project personnel that may be satisfied by visualizations. A state-of-the-art-analysis
  follows, which examines and compares existing solutions. After defining the goals
  for the new visualizations, the thesis explains the implementation of three new
  visualizations. An expert evaluation assessing the developed visualizations concludes
  the master´s thesis.'
