abstract: Disease management programs (DMP) are a modern way of treating health conditions
  and are becoming a part of standard care. One telehealth DMP service has been in
  regular operation since 2017, named "HerzMobil Tirol".This paper investigates, if
  the electronic health record standard HL7 CDA, which is widely accepted in the health
  care industry, could be used for telehealth DMP services as well. It is already
  in use in a legally required integrated element of healthcare in Austria called
  ELGA. An official guideline from the Austrian Ministry of Health sets the standard
  for telemonitoring with data logging.After the background knowledge was built up,
  requirements have been gathered through existing official guidelines and interviews
  and existing documentation by "HerzMobil Tirol".Twenty-five requirements were collected,
  categorized and analyzed to determine if the existing CDA guidelines are suitable
  or a new standard must be designed.Based on the requirements, it was established
  that seven specific sections and two different CDA documents are needed.
