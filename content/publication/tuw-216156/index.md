abstract: The usage of Enterprise Mashups enables users to create ad hoc applications
  without the need of technical knowledge. These applications can use and combine
  data sources of different systems. The integration of heterogeneous data in a new
  application is still a rather unused potential within a company.  Many companies
  work with a highly integrated ERP system, which contains the bigger part of the
  data to control the business processes. However not all necessary data is covered
  and accordingly not all processes can be controlled by the ERP system. Therefore
  the situation arises that information from various systems must be consolidated
  to make a decision. The usage of an ad hoc Mashup application, which is created
  according to necessary claims, leads to an important added value for the departments.  In
  line with this diploma thesis special requirements like data quality, the raised
  security of corporate sensitive information and the integration of legacy applications
  into Enterprise Mashups will be proved. Moreover a prototype for an Enterprise Mashup
  is implemented. The prototype shows the combination of data from the ERP system
  Microsoft Dynamics AX in conjunction with other data sources. To put it into practice
  a solution to use the ERP system as a Mashup data source is developed. Available
  Mashup frameworks have been evaluated and the one with the best correlation according
  to the requirements has been chosen for the prototype.  The implemented Mashup shows
  the fast and straightforward combination of data from various applications. The
  prototype illustrates a teaching case for companies which want to supply their employees
  with the possibility to use existing data sources in the context of an Enterprise
  Mashup. User obtain the ability to create themselves instruments on demand for the
  daily business without programming skills.
