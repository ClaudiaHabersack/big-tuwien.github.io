abstract: Gamification has been employed to make online surveys more engaging to fill.
  Related work has evaluated the psy- chological and behavioral outcome of gamified
  surveys, but has been unclear about design methods and best practices. This work
  discusses foundations, relevant design dimensions (game elements, survey areas and
  the design process), and critical issues concerning validity. It then proposes a
  struc- tured process for survey gamification based on the MDA (me- chanics, dynamics,
  aesthetics) framework. An evaluation of the proposed process within a case study
  is briefly presented along with preliminary, but promising results. The gamifi-
  cation process is put forth in the CHI community for further discussion, evaluation,
  and application.
