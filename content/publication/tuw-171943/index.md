abstract: The introduction of an electronic Patient Record (EPA) in Austria is currently
  in a plan-ning state. The implementation was commissionised by the Austrian Gouverment
  and planned by several companies and study groups, but future users are not enough
  inte-grated in this development process. Therefore this survey about acceptance
  of an EPA was performed on 170 people. This thesis analyses the opinion of these
  people about positive and negative aspects of an EPA. The survey provides information
  about expec-tations, trends, needs and affections of the people, which were asked,
  as well as their anxieties and inceritude in terms of data abuse. At first hypotheses
  about an EPA were acquired. Afterwards these hypotheses were compared with the survey
  results and ver-fied or falsified. The results showed that the bigger part (78%)
  had already some con-crete ideas about an EPA. Another result showed that there
  are no significant differ-ences between younger an older people in terms of some
  questions e.g. older people (age >40) as well as younger people (age <40) do think
  that the EPA will have a per-sonal benefit for them. Differences between older and
  younger people were found in terms of the administration of their medical data,
  stored in an EPA. Older people tend to entrust the administration to other skilled
  people whereas younger people want to ad-ministrate the data all by themselves.
  The study shows that the future user has already a concrete idea about demands and
  ideas of an EPA in Austria, although there is not much information spread into public.
  In summary an EPA on a national level isn´t going to be a success or even efficient
  without the involvation of the future user in the design- and decisionprocess.
