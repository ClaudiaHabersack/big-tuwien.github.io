From 1998 to 2003, I studied Computer Science at the Vienna Technical University. My main focus was set on theoretical computer science and programming languages. My master thesis was about virtual machines. From 2003 to 2007, I worked on my PhD thesis with the title „A Solver for Quantified Boolean Formulas in Negation Normal Form“. In 2005 I joined the Information &amp; Software Engineering Group as university assistant. Since the beginning of 2006 I am working at the Business Informatics Group as research assistant.

Since 2010 I am assistant professor at the [Institute for Formal Models](http://fmv.jku.at) at the [Johnannes Kepler Universität Linz](http://www.jku.at).
