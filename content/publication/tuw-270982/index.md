abstract: OPC Unified Architecture (UA) is a powerful technology for modeling and
  instantiating domain-specific information in a standardized manner. Its initial
  application scenario is in the domain of automated production systems, that increasingly
  have to deal with variability information, (i) regarding the products being manufactured
  and (ii) regarding the production systems themselves. In this work we propose a
  non-intrusive OPC UA information model for the modeling and querying of variability
  information using feature models, which are a well-known paradigm in the management
  of software product lines. Our information model can be applied "aside" existing
  domain information without interfering with their internal structure.
