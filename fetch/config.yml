  # The TISS API result contains user records that are not meant to be displayed.
  # All names must match the names used in TISS.
  # Therefore this whitelist can be used to filter the result set.
  # This whitelist will be the base of any blacklists, meaning this list is applied before the blacklists.

  # The publication database does not necessarily use the same names as TISS.
  # In order to link names with the user profiles, names must be transformed to the correct name identifier
  # TO represents the value all FROM values must be mapped to
  # Example:
  # - to: Max Mustermann
  #      from:
  #        - Maximilian Mustermann
  #        - M. Mustermann
  # This setup will map all names matching either "Maximilian Mustermann" or "M. Mustermann" to "Max Mustermann"
