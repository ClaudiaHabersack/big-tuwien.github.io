abstract: Reliable and complete blood-vessel segmentation is still a challenging problem.
  This is especially true in the presence of morphologic changes resulting from atherosclerotic
  diseases. In this paper we take advantage of partially segmented data with approximately
  identified vessel centerlines to comprehensively visualize the diseased peripheral
  arterial tree. We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus
  & context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium
  enhanced arteries in CT-Angiography (CT-A). The proposed techniques combine direct
  volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image.
  The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are
  used. Region type, the used visualization method and region parameters depend on
  the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting
  proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally
  looking and undistorted anatomic context. In this paper we furthermore present a
  way how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern
  3D graphics accelerators.
