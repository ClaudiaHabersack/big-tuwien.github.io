abstract: Owing to company mergers and business to business interoperability, there
  is a need for model transformation in the area of business process modeling to facilitate
  model integration and model synchronisation. This need arises, on one hand, from
  the fact that there are many different business process modeling formalisms, for
  example the ADONIS Standard Modeling Method , UML 2.1 Activity Diagram, the Event-driven
  Process Chain Method, and, the Business Process Modeling Notation. These formalisms
  provide different ways to express and represent the same aspects of business process
  modeling. On the other hand, existing model transformation approaches, like ATL,
  QVT, and Fujaba, use very general concepts for transforming models for different
  purposes. However, recurring structures have been observed when transforming models
  in the area of business process modeling. This leads to the assumption, that there
  are similar transformation problems in a distinct area. These recurring structures,
  however, are only inadequately supported by existing transformation approaches.  This
  thesis analyzes the different ways of how business process modeling aspects are
  represented in various business process modeling formalisms. Furthermore, existing
  transformation approaches are evaluated concerning their suitability for transforming
  models in the area of business process modeling. Based on this evaluation, special
  requirements and solutions for model transformations in the area of business process
  modeling are derived. These solutions lead to the construction of the Model Morphing
  approach, which consists of an integrated metamodel and morphing methods which operate
  based on this metamodel. The Model Morphing approach makes it possible to concentrate
  on the specific transformation problems within a distinct domain. Furthermore, it
  reuses existing model transformation approaches and reduces the need for excellent
  programming skills when defining model transformations.
