abstract: Current business document standards, such as EDIFACT, are defined in an
  all-embracing manner and, thus, usually include several thousands of elements. This
  is due to the fact that a standardized document type represents a superset of all
  data elements required in any industry, in any geopolitical region, etc. Furthermore,
  standardized document types are defined as stand-alone documents, similar to paper-based
  documents, comprising all information from previous process steps. In other words,
  standardization neglects the notion of processes by repeating information in different
  documents of the same process. In this paper, we propose a methodology for assessing
  redundancies in business document exchanges and evaluate different real-world industry
  message implementation guidelines (MIGs) with respect to their efficiency in reducing
  complexity and redundancies. Insights on redundancies can help companies and standardization
  committees to improve designs of MIGs and entire EDI standards. Furthermore, one
  can use the concepts presented in this paper to compare different MIGs with regard
  to their (dis)similarities, which might be useful when two organizations are to
  be merged and their IT systems consolidated.
