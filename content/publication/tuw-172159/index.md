abstract: In all federal ministries the electronic act already has been introduced
  and therefore the whole operative work is done in a continuous electronically controlled
  act treatment system by which considerable efficiency increases and cost savings
  could be reached. Also the federal states intensely work on the conversion from
  the conventional paper act to the exclusively electronically processed act (ELAK
  =electronic act). Now more and more municipalities are interested in the introduction
  of the ELAK or already plan such projects. Because of the federal organisation of
  Austria a huge number of acts are applicable and these are to be found in federal
  laws or federal state laws as well as in certain orders and decrees. By designing
  the application IT experts are confronted with the problem to identify all relevant
  regulations, to understand them properly and to convert them correctly into technical
  solutions. Also the juridical formulations often lead in engineer's circles to problems
  in their understanding. The aim of this work is the collection of all relevant juridical
  regulations which become applicable in the realisation of ELAK-supported authority's
  administrative environment. All relevant acts and orders will be explained and a
  basic understanding of the juridical requirements concerning the conversion into
  technical solutions are given. Because these regulations are scattered in many acts
  or can only be derived from the whole legal system, this paper aims to collect and
  compress all these legal requirements summarised in a criterion catalogue which
  will give a compact overview about all juridical requirements for such an ELAK system.
  Therefore this catalogue will guarantee, that all juridical problem areas can be
  identified and if necessary experts could be consulted. The aim of this paper is
  to offer a working basis for the fulfilment of these juridical requirements in ELAK
  projects, so that smaller municipalities are able to realize such projects without
  continuous juridical expert's assistance as well. The core intention of this work
  is to present all juridical requirements for the IT-supported administration of
  federal authorities, federal state authorities or local authorities. These requirements
  will be clearly categorised in textual form and are shown in a criterion catalogue
  to give an overview about the applicable acts. In this catalogue all those requirements
  will be summarized and presented as a checklist to guarantee their fulfilment.
