abstract: Agile testing is a topic that is dealt with relatively seldom in the current
  theory and practice of software testing. It definitely deserves more attention because
  agile software development has become a reality which demands appropriate approaches
  to testing. This not only changes the task areas in the test, but also brings entirely
  new focal points and responsibilities to bear. What this change means for the agile
  test will be explained in this paper using a practical project by way of example.
  The analysis reveals various problems that can arise when classic test procedure
  meets agile software development, and makes it even clearer that it is time for
  a paradigm change in software testing. At the same time, solution approaches are
  formulated and a exemplary agile test approach presented. The here introduced agile
  test approach includes a test process for agile procedural models and also reveals
  how test automation can be efficiently integrated into this. In this context, it
  will be shown how the software test in which iterative development is already established
  can make use of the continuous integration method. Furthermore, the importance of
  using appropriate tools in the agile test will be shown and therefore the significance
  of evaluating these tools. Finally, the change of the tester's role in the agile
  environment will be dealt with because agile test models also demand a new job profile
  for the tester.
