abstract: This dissertation describes, formalizes and evaluates the latest development
  toward continuous code review processes that are now part of modern software engineering
  processes such as in popular open source projects. In many software assurance techniques,
  there is a shift towards continuous processes that provide better scalability compared
  to traditional approaches. A con- tinuous and differential code review process based
  on changeset-reviews (CBR) and task-reviews (TBR) is described and is the foundation
  for a tool development. The resulting Mylyn Reviews project now provides the core
  components to build code review tools for Eclipse e.g. the Gerrit connector. This
  bridges the gap between the review infrastructure and the development environ- ment
  and is now the defacto standard for code reviews in Eclipse projects. The proposed
  processes and the corresponding tools have been adopted to the specific needs of
  software development for air traffic management (ATM) to comply with the RTCA DO-
  278/ED-109 requirements. Key factors are the full traceability to a specific software
  version, the source-code (for review coverage) and the related software requirements.
  To evaluate the indicated benefits from continuous code reviews, a comparative empirical
  study was performed in an airport operations database (AODB) software engineering
  project. The study concluded that continuous code reviews may be used for a high
  review coverage, but may be supplemented with more traditional processes for selected
  critical parts of the system to ensure effectiveness.
