abstract: In software modeling, the Object Constraint Language (OCL) is an important
  tool to specify properties that a model has to satisfy. The design of OCL reflects
  the structure of MOF-based modeling languages like UML and the tight integration
  results in an intuitive usability. However, OCL allows to express properties in
  the context of the current state of an instance model only but not with respect
  to its evolution.  In this paper, we show how OCL can be extended with CTL-based
  temporal operators to express properties over the lifetime of an instance model.
  We explain syntax and semantics of our OCL extension and provide a prototypical
  implementation of our MocOCL model checker.
