Javier Troya is a postdoctoral researcher in the Business Informatics Group at the Vienna Unviersity of Technology since October 2013. Previously, in 2009 he finished his BSc degree on Computer Science at the [University of Málaga](http://www.uma.es/?set_language=en) (Spain), and in 2010 he obtained his MSc, supervised by Prof. [Antonio Vallecillo](http://www.lcc.uma.es/%7Eav), with a Master Thesis providing a solution for giving formal semantics to [ATL](http://www.eclipse.org/atl/) by means of [Maude](http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu/). During his PhD, he spent five months in 2010 working with Prof. [Iman Poernomo](http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/staff/iman/)’s group at [King’s College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx), and four months in 2012 at [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca/) (Ontario, Canada) with Prof. [Krzysztof Czarnecki](http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/kczarnec)’s group . In 2013 he obtained his International PhD with honours at University of Málaga, also supervised by Prof. Antonio Vallecillo. His PhD Thesis dealt with the model-driven performance and reliability analysis of dynamic systems.

His current research interest comprise model transformations, non-functional properties monitoring, reverse and forward engineering techniques, especially when migrating applications to the Cloud, as well as the optimization of the latter. All these within the context of model-driven engineering (MDE).
