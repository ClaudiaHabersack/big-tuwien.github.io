abstract: This paper addresses the necessity of taking detailed and accurate measures
  of respondent behaviour generally in health-related online surveys, and particularly
  in gamified variants of these surveys. Its specific contribution is the requirements
  analysis and implementation of an open-source survey quality tool (SQT) which automates
  the detection of negative respondent behaviour. The tool can be used in health and
  wellbeing research to evaluate the quality of responses in online surveys, as well
  as for researching the impact of survey gamification.
