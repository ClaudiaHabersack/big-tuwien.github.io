abstract: The reliable, efficient and seamless exchange of business information is
  essential for a successful execution of the interwoven business processes. However,
  development of the contents for electronic data exchange is time consuming and usually
  can not follow the agile demands of the today's business. If we could contextualize
  the pieces of the currently valid business information, we could predict its possible
  context specific variations. Therefore, the business contextual knowledge in which
  the already existing data contents are valid could be exploited to (semi-) automatically
  generate new, more homogeneous contents for electronic data interchange.
