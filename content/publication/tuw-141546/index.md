abstract: We investigated the potentials and acceptance of tangible tabletop (TT)
  interfaces in functional and neural rehabilitation. Our goal was to analyse whether
  TT systems are adequate for rehabilitation and its sub categories and whether these
  tools have the potential to create an added value for both patients and therapists.
  We further investigated conventional practices and rehabilitation tools that could
  be adequately adapted to TT interfaces. Based on theoretical work and on the results
  of two focus groups with therapists and a contextual inquiry we developed three
  concepts for TT tools. Finally we present the resulting paper and interactive prototypes.
