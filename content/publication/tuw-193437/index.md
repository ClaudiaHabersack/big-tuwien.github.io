abstract: Voice over IP (VoIP) is in wide use today, replacing  phone lines in many
  scenarios. However, often, security  isnÂ´t considered well enough, even though many
  security  attacks are already known. More research on VoIP security  is needed to
  enhance the level of security of VoIP systems  and to show the implications of failing
  to take appropriate  security measures. This paper presents an architecture and  implementation
  of a robust and &#64258;exible VoIP test environ-  ment for security related tests.
  Experiences using the im-  plemented environment for different VoIP security tests
  are  shown to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed test en-  vironment for
  research purposes.
