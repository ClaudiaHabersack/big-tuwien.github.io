abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are the central data storage
  systems of companies. They are designed to integrate different business units of
  a company and are even capable of integrating systems beyond the borders of a company.
  Thus business processes can be optimized and the communication and information management
  can be improved. For many years, accessing business data was possible only from
  desktop computers inside a company. With ongoing technological advances new mobile
  forms of devices, equipped with wireless connection technologies have been developed
  and laptops, which were used for mobile applications for a long time have been replaced
  by tablets and smartphones. Access to business data via these devices can provide
  a significant advantage for a company over its competitors. Business processes are
  developing fast. They must be modified and adapted to new circumstances more frequently
  than ever before. The tools for supporting these processes must be very flexible
  and have to be able to support different types of devices without any configuration
  or modification effort. As many of the existing solutions are static, they need
  to be adapted for additional functionality. In a globalized world, this might prove
  to be a disadvantage for companies and could even threaten their existence. The
  thesis at hand addresses precisely this trend. It evaluates existing technologies
  for integrating mobile devices into an ERP-System. Furthermore, technologies for
  a generic approach are evaluated and a generic solution is presented. In order to
  illustrate and evaluate the proposed approach, a Proof of Concept implementation,
  using SAP ERP as ERP-System, has been developed. The objective is to describe in
  detail the architecture of the proposed approach, the involved systems and the communication
  process, as well as to work out the pros and cons. Finally, an evaluation of the
  presented prototype was performed.
