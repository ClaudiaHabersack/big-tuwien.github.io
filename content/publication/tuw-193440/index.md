abstract: One of the main security ob jectives for systems connected  to the Internet
  which provide services like Voice over Inter-  net Protocol (VoIP) is to ensure
  robustness against security  attacks to ful&#64257;ll Quality of Service (QoS).
  To avoid system  failures during attacks service providers have to integrate  countermeasures
  which have to be tested. This work evalu-  ates a test approach to determine the
  e&#64259;ciency of counter-  measures to ful&#64257;ll QoS for Session Initiation
  Protocol (SIP)  based VoIP systems even under attack. The main ob jective  of the
  approach is the evaluation of service availability of a  System Under Test (SUT)
  during security attacks, e.g., De-  nial of Service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, a
  simulated system  load based on QoS requirements is combined with di&#64256;erent  security
  attacks. The observation of the system is based  on black-box testing. By monitoring
  quality metrics of SIP  transactions the behavior of the system is measurable. The  concept
  was realized as a prototype and was evaluated using  di&#64256;erent VoIP systems.
  For this, multiple security attacks  are integrated to the testing scenarios. The
  outcome showed  that the concept provides sound test results, which re&#64258;ect  the
  behavior of SIP systems availability under various at-  tacks. Thus, security problems
  can be found and QoS for  SIP-based VoIP communication under attack can be pre-  dicted.
