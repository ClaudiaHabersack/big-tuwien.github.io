abstract: Europe is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), which generate
  a big part of Europe´s gross domestic product (GDP). These SMEs need a way to face
  the competition with large enterprises in order to grow and to generate sustainable
  revenues. New business structures, like a virtual organization, can be a starting
  point for a solution. But specifically virtual organizations have a lot of technical
  requirements if they are to be implemented in a real environment. Digital communication
  is the key to optimizing a business process for more than one company, requiring
  a reliable business network. Business networks face different challenges. The Supply
  Chain Management is a god example. Only the appropriate communication concept will
  work as a solution. On the one hand, this concept has to build up the whole communication
  infrastructure; on the other hand, it has to be realizable by SMEs. This thesis
  investigates the requirements for a modern middleware system that supports the Supply
  Chain Management. Furthermore new frameworks like SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)
  and DBE (Digital Business Ecosystem) will be measured ac-cording to these requirements.
  As a result the sustainability of these frameworks will be evaluated. The next step
  is to develop a concept of a vendor-managed inventory system in the DBE. In modeling
  nature, a new robust and self-optimized system will be created. This system covers
  new developments in the field of intelligent products, swarm intelligence and evolutionary
  algorithm.
