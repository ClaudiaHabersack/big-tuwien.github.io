abstract: The United Nation´s Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic<br> Business
  (UN/CEFACT) is an e-business standardization body.<br> It is known from its work
  on UN/EDIFACT and ebXML. One of its ongoing<br> work items is the UN/CEFACT modeling
  methodology (UMM) for<br> modeling global choreographies of B2B scenarios. The goal
  of UMM is<br> defining a shared business logic between business partners and fostering<br>
  reuse of standardized process building blocks. The latest UMM version<br> is defined
  as a UML 1.4 profile. In this paper we introduce the main<br> concepts of UMM to
  realize its vision. Furthermore, the paper elaborates<br> on the necessary UML meta
  model work-arounds we - as part of<br> the specification´s editing team - took in
  order to accomplish the B2B<br> requirements. Then we propose a move towards UML
  2 that eliminates<br> some of those workarounds. The paper is concluded with the
  introduction<br> of a UMM modeling tool that we implemented on top of a commercial<br>
  UML tool.
