abstract: Cities are facing an increasing number of bicycles being used by urban citizen
  and the need of monitoring and man- aging this type of traffic becomes part of municipality
  and city administration. Bicycles shall be able to communicate between each other,
  exchange data with information service providers in the city and broadcast alarm
  and emergency messages. In this work we describe a wireless sensor network infrastructure
  approach designed especially for data messaging for bicycles, being independent
  of existing networks of telecommunication operators. The proposed communication
  network is assumed to be a decentralized, chaotic ad-hoc network established by
  a transceiver mounted on each bicycle. With this approach important information
  from bicycles moving around in the city can be gathered without depending on 3rd
  party network infrastructures. This network can build the basis for further applications
  for bicycles like optimized traffic management.
