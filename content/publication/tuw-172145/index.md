abstract: In the constantly evolving software industry it is of vital importance for
  a company to document their intentions in the form of requirements documentation,
  and to communicate these requirements internally and together with their customers.
  In order to put down the requirements, authors currently mostly use word processors
  and a small set of tools to generate graphics. This combination provides very few
  features that are important to effectively create, review, and maintain a software
  requirements specification, such as transparent versioning, automated document sharing,
  and extensible integration points with external systems. The authoring framework
  presented in this thesis provides improvements at all these levels, and, due to
  the standards-based concept, integration points for existing tools. This thesis
  shows how the different parts of the framework's components - the documentation
  format, the authoring tool, and the repository - can play together to create an
  environment for efficient document authoring. Existing solutions (i.e. implementations)
  for the documentation format and authoring tool are analyzed and compared with one
  another. For both components, this thesis collects a set of criteria that can be
  used to assess how useful the solution may be for authoring processes. The results
  are taken into consideration for the eventually presented architecture and implementation
  of the authoring framework.
