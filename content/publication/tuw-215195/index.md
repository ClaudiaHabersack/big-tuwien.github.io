abstract: Code reviews are an integral part of the develop- ment of a dependable system
  such as for airport operations. It is commonly accepted that code reviews are an
  effective quality assurance technique even if a rigorous application is also a high
  cost factor. For large software systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout
  the whole codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is developed
  with the application of a more lightweight approach to code reviews. A continuous,
  distributed and change-based process is applied by the development team and evaluated
  in comparison to team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application
  showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but more efficient
  especially for the preparation, execution and rework effort. The results show that
  continuous code reviews also support the understanding of the codebase and the concept
  of collective ownership. Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal
  and effortful technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex
  items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main outcome is that
  such lightweight code reviews may be used together with more formal approaches to
  ensure a high coverage and that the degree of formalism should be adopted to the
  criticality of the item under review.
