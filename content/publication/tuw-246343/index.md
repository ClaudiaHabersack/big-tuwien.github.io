abstract: Software interrelationships have an impact on the quality and evolution
  of software projects and are therefore important to development and maintenance.
  Package management and build systems result in software ecosystems that usually
  are syntactically and semantically incompatible with each other, although the described
  software can overlap. There is currently no general way for querying software interrelationships
  across these different ecosystems. In this paper, we present our approach to combine
  and consequently query information about software interrelationships across different
  ecosystems. We propose an ontology for the semantic modeling of the relationships
  as linked data. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal storage and query model to
  handle inconsistencies between different data sources. By providing a scalable and
  extensible architecture to retrieve and process data from multiple repositories,
  we establish a foundation for ongoing research activities. We evaluated our approach
  by integrating the data of several ecosystems and demonstrated its usefulness by
  creating tools for vulnerability notification and license violation detection.
