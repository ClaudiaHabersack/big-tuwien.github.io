abstract: 'In recent years, the World Wide Web has emerged as a central part of our
  lives. Accordingly, Web Engineering nowadays is among the main activities in software
  development. However, due to their special characteristics, developing Web Applications
  is a complex task. Web Application Frameworks aim at easing this task. On the one
  hand, the proliferation of these software-tools has made the selection of a framework
  a challenging task. On the other hand, the competition also led to an ongoing equalization
  in the market. Today, the existing Web Frameworks hardly differ regarding their
  functional expressiveness, making it a insignificant criterion when choosing a framework.
  However, when Ruby on Rails was released in the end of 2005, it unmasked that Web
  development till then lacked an important factor: Productivity. Since that time,
  also Web Frameworks in the Java environment are increasingly facing rapid development.
  Five years after the first version of Rails, this thesis describes the current state-of-the-art
  in rapid Web development with Java. It analyzes the technical factors that altogether
  define a Web Application Framework''s productivity. The resulting catalog encompasses
  more than 120 criteria. This way, it can answer the question of which particular
  Web Framework to choose in an upcoming project. The catalog can also be used to
  base new comparisons on it and it may even foster further developments in the market.'
