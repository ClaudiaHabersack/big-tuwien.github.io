abstract: Many challenges in the economy as well as in the society were faced in the
  context of tangible project execution. That´s why nowadays huge demand for professionalism
  and standardization of project activities arises. In the framework of this paper
  Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are focused to identify present project management
  trends for the area of the third sector. Consequently the emphasis lies on the analyses
  of the technologies and methods, which are used in such a surrounding. To analyze
  these aspects, as-is analyses are conducted. Two NGOs with international work environment,
  which are Austrian Red Cross (ÖRK) and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
  (UNODC), are consulted as examination objects for this empirical study. Project
  management structures and project management organisations in these NGOs are examined
  in depth, whereby in the framework of this paper different focuses are set. Thus
  ÖRK is analyzed by organisation oriented view, so that particularly project management
  approaches, project management standards, project organisations and concrete procedure
  during a project are evaluated. In contrast to that UNODC is viewed from a system
  oriented perspective, so that technological aspects are dwelled on. For the collection
  of these data interviews with experts were conducted. These interrogations showed
  that in the ÖRK the project management approach of project planning process was
  used, whereas in the UNODC the information system ProFi was available to support
  project management. In both cases self developments were applied, because the market
  did not offer appropriate and price efficient tools. The reason therefore is that
  the development of adequate project management tools gears mainly towards the demand
  of commercial oriented companies. Finally possible optimization potentials are derived
  for more efficient project management such as the application of web portals from
  the findings, which have been gained through the analyses of the case studies.
