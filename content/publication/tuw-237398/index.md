abstract: With April 1st, 2012 the implementation of Directive 2006/24/EC on the retention
  of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available
  electronic communications services, or of public communications networks came into
  effect in Austria. With this implementation, not only the obligations of the providers
  of telecommunications services are controlled with respect to the retention of communications
  data, but also the powers of the security and law enforcement authorities with respect
  to request both retention data as well as traditional connection data (e.g., security
  police in the course of fulfilment of affairs). To make the retrieval of such data
  as transparent as possible, legally secure and traceable, all requests (with only
  few exceptions) must be carried out only via the so-called DLS, a central exchange
  service. This allows preventing unauthorized or hidden inquiries practically and
  not just legally. Both requests and replies must be transmitted only over HTTPS
  connections to the DLS and must further be secured using end-2-end encryption, enforcing
  a blind central service.
