In the field of industrial software development, the processes that are implemented are becoming increasingly complex, however these should remain easily modifiable and maintainable. In order to meet these requirements, these processes tend to rely on Model-Driven-Software development. With growing industrial digitization (Industry 4.0), interfaces between people and network plants are gaining substantial importance. Much is demanded of these HMIs such as intuitivity, ease of use, simplicity and at the same time providing a wealth of information at the right moment to users and allowing fast interaction with other interfaces. Typically, the development of Model-Driven software and development of associated Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) are separated from one another. The HMIs are either developed manually, domain-specific for the application and the underlying model or SCADA/HMI tools are used to generate these HMIs. Although many elements of the model and HMI go hand in hand and much of the model is mapped directly in the HMI, these are developed separately. These circumstances lead to a more complex development and require longer planning phases and therefore increase the costs. In the course on this thesis, a tool supported research will be conducted to provide a basis to easily generate HMIs for any model. AutomationML will be used as an example for demonstration purposes. The aim is to reduce the additional development effort and cost, resulting from the domain-specific separated development of the HMIs.
