abstract: There is a big potential for process optimizations, due to the digitalization
  gap in the construction business. New digital technologies, as the Building Information
  Modelling (BIM), are increasingly being adapted by the stakeholders in this area.
  On the other hand, blockchain is a very new and innovative technology domain which
  has grown immensely in the last several years, and where people are now trying to
  find the right use-cases. Especially, the even newer field of smart contract development
  has opened the door for a large amount of possible applications, where it is neither
  clear if these can actually be implemented as envisioned, nor if there is even a
  need for a decentralized solution at all. In a construction project, changes on
  BIM models are only to be approved by the appropriate stakeholder. Therefore, we
  have combined the BIM models, which are stored using a Git repository, with a release
  management workflow, which is realised as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.This
  enables the workflow to be transparent, traceable and its results to be immutable.
  The goal of this work is to create a prototype and compare it to other (off-chain)
  solutions and to evaluate if an application of a combination of BIM and blockchain
  yields an advantage in terms of costs and security.
