abstract: The increasing complexity of software and IT systems creates the necessity
  for research on technologies addressing current key security challenges. To meet
  security problems in IT infrastructures, a security engineering process has to be
  established. One crucial factor contributing to a higher level of security is the
  reliable detection of security vulnerabilities during security tests. We observe
  the behavior of the system under test and introduce machine learning methods based
  on derived behavior metrics. This improves the accuracy of the security test result
  of an automated security testing approach. Reliable automated determination of security
  failures in security test results increases the security quality of the tested software
  and avoids costly manual validation.
