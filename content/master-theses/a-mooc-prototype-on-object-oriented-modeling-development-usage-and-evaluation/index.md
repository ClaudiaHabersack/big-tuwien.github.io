Learning methods have changed over the years mainly due to technological innovations. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a new way of learning. A course is often taken by several hundreds to several thousands of persons. Compared to other learning models, MOOCs are completely open and everybody can take courses via the world wide web. The aim of this Master Thesis is to develop, use and evaluate a MOOC prototype in the area of Object-Oriented Modeling (OOM).
