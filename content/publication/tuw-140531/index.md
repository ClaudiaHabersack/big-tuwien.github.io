abstract: 'UN/CEFACTÂ´s Modeling Methodology (UMM) is a well accepted approach to define
  inter-organizational business processes. UMM models should be managed in a registry
  for two reasons: Firstly, business partners supporting the process can find it and
  bind to it. Secondly, a model - or more important parts thereof - may be reused
  in another model of an inter-organizational process. Accordingly, registering one
  model as one object in a registry is not appropriate. Those parts of a model that
  may be reused must become registry objects themselves. Extracting parts of a model
  results in objects that are logically inter-related. Thus, a registry model taking
  care of these inter-relationships is needed. In this paper we present a so-called
  business collaboration registry model that sits on top of the ebRIM (ebXML registry
  information model) in order to manage UMM business collaboration models in an ebXML
  registry. Furthermore, we outline the registry management functions for maintaining
  models in the registry.'
