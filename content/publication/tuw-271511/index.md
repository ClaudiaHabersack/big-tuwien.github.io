abstract: 'IEC 62264-2 and AutomationML can co-exist as separate views on the same
  production system, but there is some overlap with respect to the definitions of
  the entities in IEC 62264-2 and AutomationML. Therefore, a semantic alignment of
  entities as well as two methods for integration are proposed: (i) tagging AutomationML
  elements with IEC 622664-2 roles and (ii) referencing external IEC 62264-2 data.'
