abstract: As IT systems became more and more pervasive in companies, their stability,  reliability
  and maintainability, as well as the demand for their enhancement,  steadily increased.
  Due to the historical development in the last decades,  IT systems are disjoined
  and redundancies are prevalent. It is a problem  to combine several complex independent
  systems and their dependencies in  addition to improving the systems usability,
  security, reliability, availability, fail safety, e&#64259;ciency and maintainability.  The
  purpose of this study is to investigate the requirements of a uni&#64257;ed  market
  data system as a case study for a typical complex IT system and  analyze possible
  implementation options within a bank. This is motivated  by the expected increase
  in precision of the key &#64257;gures and the ability to  compare &#64257;gures
  from independent systems which will then have a uni&#64257;ed  database for their
  calculations. The applicability of the design patterns is  shown within a prototype.
  Legal frameworks, regulatory authorities and  internal quality management contribute
  to the growing requirements for IT  systems.  The approach taken comprises understanding
  the historical development  of the legacy systems, analyzing the current state,
  de&#64257;ning requirements for  a new system and &#64257;nding implementation options
  which &#64257;t the requirements.  Concluding in a &#64257;nal general implementation
  plan it is shown that an in  depth requirements analysis and state of the art best
  practices are a possible  approach for unifying an information system in a sustainable
  way.
