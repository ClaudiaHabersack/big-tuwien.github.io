abstract: Workflow technology promises an increase in efficiency in the execution
  of business processes. The technology is widely accepted, but often the high costs
  exceed the promised benefits. Thus, it is desirable to calculate the profitability
  prior to investing into workflow technology. After an investment into workflow management
  systems (WFMS), it has to be verified whether the expected benefits have been realized
  or not. In this paper we present a method that covers both, the cost-benefit-ratio
  calculations specially customized for WFMS and the calculation of the realized savings.
  The profitability analysis is based on simple measurable performance indicators
  that consider the tangible calculation of costs as well as the quantitative and
  qualitative benefits. Long time practical experience in implementing and operating
  workflow management supported the design of the method. The method presented in
  this paper has been successfully used in the IT company of a banking corporation.
