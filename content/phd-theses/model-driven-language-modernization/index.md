The introduction of Extensible Markup Language (XML) represented a tremendous leap towards the design of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).&nbsp;Although XML-based languages are well adopted and flexible, their generic editors miss modern DSL editor functionality.&nbsp;Additionally, artifacts defined with such languages lack comprehensibility and, therefore, maintainability, because XML has primarily been designed as a machine-processable format with immutable concrete syntax.&nbsp;While there exist techniques to migrate XML-based languages to modeling languages, they are composed of manual steps demanding complex language engineering skills that are usually not part of a domain engineerâ€™s skill set. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose a bridge between XML-based languages and text-based modeling languages.&nbsp;This includes the automated and customizable generation of Xtext-based editors from XML schema definitions (XSDs) providing advanced editor functionality, individualized textual concrete syntax style, and round-trip transformations enabling the exchange of data between the two languages.&nbsp;For the evaluation of the approach, we plan to conduct case studies as well as user studies based on industrial-strength markup languages that will be transformed to textual modeling languages including editors that are intended to be at least as powerful as those manually built for XML-based languages.
