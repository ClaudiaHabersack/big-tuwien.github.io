abstract: 'A reference model can be defined as structured domain knowledge, which
  is in most cases illustrated over business processes. Today there exists a big variety
  of reference models for different domains (trade, industry, ...), with different
  modelling languages and modelling depth. So far, there exists no generally accepted
  standard for the description of reference models. This paper presents the scientific
  status of reference modelling, and the methods of modelling the reference models,
  and applying them in the area of the credit process in the retail area of a universal
  bank. The phase model for konfiguration reference modelling represents a well-known
  method for reference modelling. It consists of five phases: to define the aim of
  the project, the reference modelling technology, the reference model, the evaluation
  of the reference model and finally the last phase is to market the reference model.
  For the reference modelling the modelling language EPK (event-controlled process
  chains) is particularly suitable, which can also be used by people with no or less
  knowledge in process modelling. The credit process was divided into several subprocesses
  to support the intelligibility, general validity, adaptability and applicability
  of the reference model. Furthermore the complete credit process was illustrated
  and the content of the functions were described in the text. By the use of ARIS
  Business Architect, as modelling tool, not only the individual functions and events
  were shown, but also the persons, documents and application systems involved. To
  get a praxis oriented reference model, experts in banking were interviewed. The
  information gained is part of the model´s content. The developed reference model
  contains all important process steps of the creditprocess and can be used for qualitative
  improvement, as well as for temporal acceleration of the application development.'
