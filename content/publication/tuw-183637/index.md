abstract: Maintenance of software is risky, potentially expensive - and inevitable.
  The main objective of this study is to examine the relationship of code change,
  referred to as maintenance effort, with source-level software metrics. This approach
  varies from the typical approach of evaluating software metrics against failure
  data and provides a different angle on the validation of software metrics. The goal
  of this study is to show through exhaustive data mining that a relation between
  software metrics and code change exists.  Once this connection is established, a
  set of software metrics is identified, which will be used in further studies to
  predict code change in problematic modules identified by the software metrics at
  an early development stage.
