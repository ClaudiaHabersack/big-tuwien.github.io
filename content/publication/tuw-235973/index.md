abstract: 'Our experience with email-based marketing campaigns (or short: "Microservices")
  showed that they are an intersecting set of a) projects and processes and b) technology
  and creativity. Their properties of fixed due date, fixed scope and at the same
  time fixed duration render classical management methodologies unfeasible. The same
  applies to the supporting enterprise infrastructure architecture, where ad-hoc changes
  lead to a loss of stability and performance. The remedy was found in Model-Driven
  Engineering; a choreography for Microservices helped to indicate improvement opportunities
  for both the architecture and the information flow within, which in turn increased
  throughput.'
