I studied Computer Science at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, where I recieved my masterâ€™s degree in 2010. My master thesis was about data integration in the field of bioinformatics. During my master I also studied at the University of Tampere (Finland) for a year. Since the beginning of 2011 I am working as a research assistent at the Business Informatics Group.
