abstract: In software modeling, the Object Constraint Language (OCL) is an important
  language to specify properties that a model has to satisfy. The design of OCL reflects
  the structure of MOF-based modeling languages like UML and its tight integration
  results in an intuitive usability. But OCL allows to express properties only in
  the context of a single instance model and not with respect to a sequence of instance
  models that capture the execution of the system. In this paper, we show how OCL
  can be extended with CTL-based temporal operators to express properties over the
  lifetime of an instance model. We formally ntroduce syntax and semantics of our
  OCL extension cOCL. The properties specified with our OCL extension can be verified
  with our explicit state space model checking framework, called MocOCL. In a case
  study, we illustrate the expressiveness and usability of our approach and evaluate
  the performance of our implementation.
