abstract: Banks were very early on familiar with the handling of mass data and needed
  therefore to adopt IT already back in the Sixties. The legacy systems used in the
  back-office were implemented in machine-orientated languages such as COBOL or Assembler
  whose basic structures remain virtually unchanged to this day although more and
  more additional developments made these systems become increasingly complex. As
  a consequence of this historic growth the highly integrated systems are very poorly
  documented, are not transparent and hard to maintain. Likewise to this day there
  are no consistent standards for data communication. The incentive for the present
  thesis were the extremely expensive implementation and the ever increasing maintenance
  costs of non-standardised interfaces in the legacy-systems as well as in the proprietary
  formats used in cross-company data transfer. The following also includes an analysis
  of the interface-problem which arises within the internal IT-systems in the banks
  as well as during the data transfer to external partners of the bank. To exemplify
  the inherent problems of the subject in question, the system INPAR established by
  the First Data Austria Company is introduced in the following as a case study. INPAR
  is a typical system used for the automated cross-bank data transfer including access
  to mainframe databases. It will be demonstrated that in this instance the application
  of more advanced technologies for the data transfer would bring considerable advantages.
  From the resulting analysis it emerges that both XML (as data format) as well as
  XML Schema (as meta language) will continue to be used in banks, which applies not
  only to the case study but to the standardisation of the European payment system
  as well. Furthermore it has been pointed out that in the case of INPAR the use of
  Web Services with open, internet-based protocols would result in considerable benefits
  due to greater flexibility and more option for expansion. In conclusion it is demonstrated,
  that recent technologies can be applied to the interprocess-communication of highly
  complex, historically evolved systems with all the resulting benefits.
