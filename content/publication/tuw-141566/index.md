abstract: Sports science is much older than computer science. Conflicts occur in both
  fields and these conflicts need to be resolved somehow. Therefore the question arose
  as to what extent conflicts in both sciences are comparable. So this paper tries
  to analyse how experience gained from conflicts and their solutions in high-performance
  sport can be conveyed to teams in software engineering. For this purpose the sport
  literature were searched for conflicts in elite sport teams. The conflicts found
  were categorised and applied to similar situations in software engineering teams.
  It appears that conflicts in team sport are indeed comparable to conflicts in software
  engineering teams and that conflict solutions from top sport can be applied to computer
  science. From the strategies for conflict solution a process was developed which
  allows to establish integrated conflict management in software engineering --- from
  each team member to the whole project.
