abstract: The explosive growth of online retail within the last years has increased
  competition among companies selling over the internet. Thus, vendors are looking
  for new possibilities to increase site traffic and consecutively revenue on their
  platforms. Social commerce, primarily applicable for B2C and C2C e-commerce, is
  a very effective approach because it enables customers to generate content in an
  interactive way. Active user participation and collaboration within the whole online
  shopping sphere clearly leads to more customer satisfaction. This paper demonstrates
  how vendors and site owners should upgrade their conventional online stores with
  interactive collaboration tools to achieve requirements of a state-of-the-art social
  commerce environment. Based on a designed social shopping framework, essential tools
  and elements were identified, categorized and described. Summarized in an image
  map, affected areas of the social commerce framework as well as the main categories
  of interactive collaboration tools are illustrated.
