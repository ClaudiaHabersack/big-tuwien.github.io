abstract: This thesis covers the transformation of interorganizational business processes
  in the area of business-to-business (B2B) electronic commerce. It builds upon the
  approach devised as part of the Business Semantics on top of Process Technology
  (BSOPT) project. BSopt aims to integrate management-, administration- and IT perspectives
  in B2B collaborations as inspired by the Open-edi reference model into one consistent
  tool environment. The resulting BSopt Designer tool was extended by the use of visual
  domain specific languages (DSLs) encompassing the concepts given in Open-edi. Additionally,
  C# developed transformation wizards were created to support a semi-automatic mapping
  from business models to business process models and, finally, to technologically
  dependent executable deployment artifacts. The thesis describes the contributions
  to the BSopt approach starting with the transformation of business process descriptions
  as seen by a neutral observer into a participant-view dependent design. It continues
  to show, how these so called ``local choreographies" are transformed further into
  concrete Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) 4.0 based workflow artifacts
  ready for integration into the service oriented architecture (SOA) of IT environments.
  In doing so we also accommodate adapted business document specifications into the
  transformation process. These specifications are used in business processes to define
  which messages are sent or received at any point in time during a B2B collaboration.
  The last contribution to the BSopt approach comes in the form of an example business
  application. It supports the one-click hosting of generated workflow artifacts and
  acts as a tool to test the validity and correct functionality of the generated workflows.
  An accompanying example scenario involving both buyer and seller in a typical ordering
  process is introduced early in the thesis. It acts as an ongoing demonstration of
  the different views on business processes and finally illustrates, how the decisions
  of the involved parties influence the outcome of the business process in the example
  business application.
