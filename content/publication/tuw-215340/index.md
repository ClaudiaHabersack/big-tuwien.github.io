abstract: One of the biggest challenges when developing new components or workflows
  for Hospital Information Systems (HIS) is the lack of a freely available stable
  core system with integration capabilities for various clinical and administrative
  subsystems. We created a prototype of an OpenEHR based HIS which can be used as
  a core system for the development of new clinical applications and for prototyping
  research ideas. We created an integration framework with standard open source components
  based on JBoss ESB and JBoss Drools. The implementation also includes an exemplary
  integration of an open source ERP (Openbravo) and open source PACS (DCM4CHEE) and
  shows that the proposed architecture results in an highly maintainable core architecture.
