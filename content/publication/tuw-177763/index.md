abstract: In the field of business document standardization a multitude of different
  standardization efforts exist. Unfortunately, most of the developed standards are
  designed for a specific application domain or industry and do not consider cross-standard
  interoperability. This results in several incompatible standard definitions. Without
  the provision of a common semantical basis for business document definitions, cross-domain
  interoperability cannot be achieved.  In this paper we provide a methodology for
  building a global reference ontology based on the Core Components Technical Specification
  (CCTS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). Using our approach a common semantic business
  document basis is developed. New document definitions may be derived from this basis
  and existing document definitions may be aligned to it. Using our 'derivation-by-restriction'
  mechanism, instances derived from a common semantical basis are interoperable to
  each other. Thus, mapping mechanisms between different standard definitions may
  be implemented in an easier and semantically correct manner.
