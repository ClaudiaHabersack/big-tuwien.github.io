abstract: The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology has its roots in the accounting
  discipline and was originally developed as a reference framework to conceptualize
  economic phenomena in an enterprise. In its proposal in 1982, McCarthy already had
  the vision to facilitate the design of data structures of accounting information
  systems by means of REA. Since this time the REA model has been further extended
  and evolved into a domain ontology. All REA concepts are based on well established
  concepts of the literature in economic theory - which is certainly one of the strengths
  of REA. However, REA has no dedicated representation format and, consequently, no
  graphical syntax. Thus, users may struggle when describing the REA models leading
  to the impression that REA is a rather heavy-weight approach. A dedicated graphical
  syntax - such as it exists for e3-value - may help in overcoming this problem and
  may lead to a much more significant adoption of REA. Accordingly, we have started
  the endeavor of developing a domain specific modeling language for REA.
