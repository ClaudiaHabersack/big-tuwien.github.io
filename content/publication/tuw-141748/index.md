abstract: We propose a set of design dimensions that constitute the axes of a taxonomy
  for ambient information systems. The dimensions are based on an investigation of
  a wide range of research projects and related papers. We rank 19 ambient information
  systems on each axis to demonstrate the utility of the taxonomy. We further discuss
  other similar taxonomies and compare them to our approach.
