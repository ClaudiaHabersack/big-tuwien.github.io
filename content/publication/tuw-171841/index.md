abstract: Today, water usage in general is of concern as water is becoming a more
  and more scarce resource worldwide. The task is to make people more aware of their
  water consumption. This awareness is necessary to change oneÂ´s water consumption
  behavior and consequently be able to save water in the long term.  Problems with
  existing water meters are, on the one hand, the place they are installed in. In
  general, they are not easily accessible and thus the meter is seldom read off. On
  the other hand, reading these meters requires a high cognitive load. Therefore,
  conventional meters cannot deliver appropriate direct feedback.  The suggested solution
  proposes the usage of ambient displays directly in the spatial context of water
  consumption. The advantage of ambient displays is that they are aesthetically pleasing
  objects and deliver feedback in an unobtrusive and subtle way.  The application
  developed addresses the daily morning shower. Since this shower can take from 3
  up to 30 minutes, there is great potential of creating awareness and saving water.
  Through the use of an ambient display, the imaginary water level if the drain was
  closed can be visualized. This can help to create a perception of how much water
  is actually consumed.
