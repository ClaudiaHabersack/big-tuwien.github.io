abstract: We steadily aim at improving our first yearÂ´s university course Introduction
  to Object-Oriented Modelling. To that end we explore how technological teaching
  support may be used to extend the classical classroom experience for the students.
  For several years, we used Web-based out-of-the-box e-learning tools for providing
  additional teaching support. This solution works well, but has some severe restrictions.
  In this paper, we show how to overcome these restrictions with a custom implementation.
  Further, we are now starting to explore mobile facilities as offered by smartphone
  Apps as well as social media facilities in order to enhance the learning experience
  in our modelling course. We report on our first experiences with these kinds of
  technologies.
