abstract: In our project BSopt we have developed a model-driven approach towards inter-organizational
  systems. During its evaluation phase we recognized that different partner networks
  operate similar, but still slightly differ in some details. However, our current
  approach is limited with respect to re-use of models or parts thereof for different
  partner networks. Thus, we plan to incorporate well established design techniques
  from reference modeling into our approach leading to inter-organizational reference
  models. We believe that inter-organizational reference models will speed up the
  development and will improve the quality of inter-organizational systems. In this
  position paper we outline our plans of integrating the design techniques of reference
  modeling into inter-organizational system development even if we do not provide
  a solution yet.
