### Topic

The development of complex software systems requires appropriate abstraction mechanisms in terms of model-driven engineering techniques (MDE) and proper support for allowing developers to work in parallel in terms of version control systems (VCS). For realizing the vision of MDE, a bundle of standards for model transformations, model storage, and model exchange has been made available recently, whereas the versioning of models has not gained the necessary attention yet, although being of paramount importance for the success of MDE in practice. Existing VCS in the area of MDE suffer from three main deficiencies comprising erroneous conflict detection, unsupportive conflict resolution and inflexibility with respect to domain-specific modeling languages (DSLs) and associated tools. With AMOR (Adaptable Model Versioning) we propose novel semantic-based methods and techniques to leverage version control in the area of MDE. The innovations of AMOR are manifested in three key research goals. Firstly, AMOR aims at precise conflict detection, i.e. previously undetected as well as wrongly indicated conflicts should be avoided. For this, we incorporate knowledge about the type of modifications the models have undergone and knowledge about the semantics of the modeling concepts used. Secondly, AMOR focuses on an intelligent conflict resolution by providing techniques for the representation of conflicting modifications as well as relieving users from repetitive tasks by suggesting proper resolution strategies. Thirdly, AMOR targets at an adaptable versioning framework, empowering the user to flexibly balance between reasonable adaptation effort and proper versioning support while ensuring generic applicability to various DSLs and associated tools. The solutions to these challenges are realized by means of the AMOR prototype. The method for evaluating AMOR builds on three major pillars, comprising experiments, empirical studies and a case study, integrating AMOR into the commercial UML-tool Enterprise Architect. Thus, AMOR will represent a research test bed as well as an industrial showcase for further commercial exploitation.
