abstract: 'Lean Development, also known as "Just in Time" Production, has found its
  way into Software Engineering in recent years and is also beginning to grow in popularity
  in Austria. The dynamic software process is implementing a "Pull" system that also
  shows similarities to Agile Processes. The aim of this master thesis is to develop
  a concept that connects Lean Development by example of "Kanban" with the Agile Software
  Process "Scrum" in order to combine the strengths of both processes. The first part
  of the thesis deals with the development of a concept, which contains characteristics
  of both Kanban and Scrum. The second part covers a practical test of the concept.
  Parts of the concept have been selected for this case study. This practical ex-amination
  of the concept promises additional feedback to be used for further improve-ment
  of the concept. The results of the practical test show that the combination of Kanban
  and Scrum pre-sents a sound approach to efficient project management. Priorities
  in software projects, for instance, are subject to change due to a variety of unforeseen
  reasons. By employing the dynamic Kanban workflow IT professionals are given a tool,
  which offers the flexi-bility to cope with changes in priorities and thus ensure
  the efficient execution of the project. Scrum-own properties of the concept, on
  the other hand, like Retrospective and Review, managed to introduce reflecting and
  progress-checking procedures to the dynamic envi-ronment of Kanban. As a timeframe
  for these procedures a "Sprint without commit-ment" has been developed as part of
  the concept, which proved to be a very suitable means to set a time for Retrospective
  and Review while not submitting to Scrum''s Sprint Commitment, which couldn''t be
  handled by a Kanban workflow. Another result of the thesis at hand is the extension
  of the Scrum Task Board to a Kan-ban Board: By means of the workflow''s close-to-reality
  visualization, bottle necks could be identified and natural waiting times that every
  process has could be modeled as queues.'
