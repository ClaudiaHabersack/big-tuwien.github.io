abstract: Despite standardization efforts the seamless exchange of business documents
  often poses a problem, due to a large number of different formats. Also, there may
  be several standards initiatives in the same business domain, all equally important.
  <br> <br> Consequently, transformation between various document formats on the instance
  layer becomes necessary. To ease the implementation of transformers we propose an
  XSLT-based generation framework that allows for bidirectional transformations. Furthermore,
  we rely on Core Components as an intermediary format. As a proof of concept we developed
  a prototype based on the open source tool named VIENNA Add-In.
