abstract: This masterÂ´s thesis proposes a software visualization that aims at analyzing
  software quality metric trends and identifying possible causes of change. The idea
  is based on the specific information needs of software developers that are hard
  to satisfy. These information needs were found with an analysis of the state-of-the-art
  literature. A review of existing software visualization tools revealed that it is
  beneficial to combine finegrained quality metric trends with code difference views
  based on data from version control repositories. This combination allows for easier
  access to relevant code changes compared to existing software visualization solutions
  and satisfies some of the previously mentioned information needs. A scenario-based
  expert evaluation revealed that the proposed software visualization prototype makes
  the comprehension of code- and code-quality changes easier and has added value compared
  to current solutions. Experts were also asked to rate selected use cases of the
  prototype to emphasize its practical usefulness. On the System Usability Scale,
  the prototype is rated "Good".
