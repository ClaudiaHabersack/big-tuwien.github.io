abstract: 'The implementation of a domain agnostic software system (such as an enterprise
  resource planning system or a trading information system) based on the REA model
  requires a generic, yet highly adaptable software architecture. Building on top
  of well established academic findings and proposals regarding the REA model we are
  proposing a software model building on two main concepts: fragments and declarations.
  Together they establish a single, exible, extendible class hierarchy implemented
  purely on a database layer. Fragments and declarations are implemented as associative
  arrays that are enriched with metadata, providing clear access to attributes and
  their meta information. The system''s exibility is drastically increased by enabling
  the multi-typification of REA entities.'
