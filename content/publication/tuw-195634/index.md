abstract: The implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in
  a company is a cost- and time-consuming process. In the literature some sources
  deal with the ERP selection in larger companies. The existing criteria for the comparison
  of ERP system architectures either neglect the technical criteria or are at a very
  detailed, technical level. However, great need for the analysis of the specific
  requirements and circumstances which exists during this process in small and medium
  size enterprises is given. With decreasing company size are the decisions about
  the ERP selection usually made directly and without a lengthy and costly selection
  process. The technological complexity and the increasing demands of small and medium
  size enterprises towards the technical integration capability of the implemented
  ERP solution increase the risk of an incorrect, subsequently costly, decision. An
  observation of the selection procedure applied in practice show a lack of decision
  making aids which handle the technical complexity properly. This leads to the fact,
  that the technical aspects are hardly part of the decision basis. The focus of this
  thesis is on a group of companies, the "orchestra companies," which are based on
  the definition of the European Commission between small businesses with fewer than
  50 employees and medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 250 employees. This thesis
  develops for the company class "orchestra company" a relevant and easily applicable
  technical criteria catalog, which can be used during the ERP selection process for
  the comparative analysis of in the market available ERP solutions. Therefore, the
  technical criteria and their indicators are split in the areas adaptability, integration
  capability, migration ability, performance, and maintainability. The increasing
  need for availability of the developed criteria catalog is highlighted by existing
  market potential in this market segment. Alone the Western European ERP market for
  companies with up to 100 employees has a size of one billion Euros and a growth
  rate of approx. 7%. In recent years more and more ERP manufacturers have begun to
  focus on the segment of small and medium size enterprises. One of the reasons is
  the saturation of the ERP market for large companies.
