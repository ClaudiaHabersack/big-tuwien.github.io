abstract: Nowadays e-participation platforms are not very widespread in Austria. Furthermore
  Austrian administrations lack a single point of contact whereby citizens can report
  their requests and concerns regarding public nuisances, such as defective traffic
  lights, potholes, etc. However, public issue reporting systems supported by geographical
  information systems and smartphones, like the Great Britain based FixMyStreet, show
  that demand exists for such platforms and single points of contact. On a small scale
  - though not nationwide - first developments aimed at providing homogenous channels
  for a citizen-to-administration communication can be noticed in Germany and Austria
  as well. Nevertheless, all of these systems lack support for automated determination
  of responsibilities for the reported problems as well as mechanisms regarding a
  flexible integration with existing administration IT infrastructure. These features
  are considered essential for a nationwide adoption of public issue reporting systems.
  The goal of this thesis is therefore to draft a public issue reporting system which
  offers the aforementioned features and is supported by geographical information
  systems and by smartphones. The first step towards reaching this goal is to get
  an overview of relevant topics via literature research and a survey of expert opinions
  in the fields of e-government and public issue reporting. Based on the findings,
  a requirements catalogue is generated. This catalogue is used to devise a list of
  criteria providing the basis for an evaluation of existing public issue reporting
  systems with regard to their suitability for a nationwide adoption in Austria. Using
  the aforementioned criteria, three open source systems are evaluated, and some of
  the unfulfilled requirements found during this evaluation process are further specified
  and then drafted. As a final step, a prototype of a graphical user interface is
  designed in order to demonstrate how such a platform can be realised.
