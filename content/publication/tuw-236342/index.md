abstract: Classical telephony has been radically changed by the ongoing networking
  of systems and services and the associated crossover into Internet services, in
  both the private and business domains. Voice over IP (VoIP) systems have become
  well established and have gained widespread acceptance. However, the very popularity
  of these VoIP systems means they now face new forms of attacks and types of attackers.
  Therefore securing VoIP systems is now of paramount importance to companies and
  organizations, for example to thwart industrial espionage or the compromising of
  their communications. Establishing adequate VoIP security mechanisms is a continuous
  process which must be adapted to evolving threats. The threats to VoIP systems must
  be evaluated on the basis of known attacks as well as by collecting ongoing attacks
  on VoIP systems, in order to better understand the pattern of new attacks and the
  behavior of attackers. A combination of theoretical and empirical analysis (by capturing
  real-world attacks using a honeynet) was used to gain information about the real-world
  threats to VoIP systems. This information was used to establish security measures
  for the most important attacks, which were then implemented in a transparent VoIP
  security layer. This layer offers a resource optimized protocol for the end-to-end
  encryption of client-server communication (SIP) and client-client communication
  (RTP). Therefore, it protects both the conversation content and the meta-data associated
  with the communication. By using strong authentication and encryption mechanisms
  (which take into account the disadvantages of previous approaches), the risk of
  identity theft and eavesdropping on a conversation are lowered to an acceptable
  level. A proof of concept of this security layer, implemented with a standard VoIP
  architecture, proved its applicability and usefulness for mobile telephony. This
  applied security approach shows, that by integrating the VoIP security layer, the
  security of currently deployed VoIP systems can be raised to an appropriate level
  and they can be used without reservation for critical communications.
