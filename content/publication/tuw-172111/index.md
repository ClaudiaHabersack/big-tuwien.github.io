abstract: Distributed Denial of Service attacks are the major threat for public web
  services today. The DDoS attack traffic uses the same protocols and usage patterns
  as a legitimate user. Therefore attack traffic and user traffic can hardly be distinguished.
  In this document the possible attack methods are derived from the used protocols
  (IP, TCP, HTTP) and the impact of these attacks to the service area is demonstrated.
  Refering to the attack methods, possible defence mechanisms are listed. The source
  of these mechanisms are practical solutions, research projects, and commercial vendors.
  Beside that, new defence methods were designed, implemented and described in this
  document. Some of these techniques can be combined to comprehensive defence systems,
  which help to protect against arbitrary DDoS attacks.
