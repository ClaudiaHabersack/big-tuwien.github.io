abstract: JavaScript can be used in web development as programming language for creating
  modern user interfaces. This technology enables short loading times and fast, interactive
  user interfaces. With the help of JavaScript MV* frameworks the source code can
  be structured like in server-side technologies. In the past few years the amount
  of these frameworks increased rapidly. Large IT companies like Google and Yahoo
  push on with their own frameworks as well. Consequently a large diversity of JavaScript
  MV* frameworks emerged, regarding their scope and functionality. For potential users
  of the frameworks it-s a longdrawn-out process to select a suitable framework for
  a certain purpose. The goal of this thesis is to support this procedure, by providing
  a suitable evaluation method, which checks the JavaScript MV* frameworks for the
  required quality. Methodically the thesis starts with the preparation of the theoretical
  principles and the subsequent search for a quality model, which can be used for
  evaluating the quality of JavaScript MV* frameworks. Most suitable for this purpose
  is the ISO/IEC 9126 standard. It was adapted to the methodology of programming a
  sample application. The primary contribution of the present thesis is a novel method
  for evaluating JavaScript MV* frameworks. Users of this proposed method implement
  a sample application using several frameworks. This allows them to measure the quality
  of the frameworks using quality models from the ISO/IEC 9126 standard. The applicability
  and utility of the introduced method was confirmed in a first case study. The added
  value of the thesis consists in the proposed evaluation process, which is realized
  with the help of a quality model. The quality model enables the user to determine
  the quality focus and evaluate JavaScript MV* frameworks with defined metrics. In
  this way, a suitable framework can be selected for a certain purpose. Since the
  evaluation is limited to a first case study, the introduced method should be executed
  and evaluated in future work on a large scale.
