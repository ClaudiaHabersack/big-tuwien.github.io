abstract: Due to the increase of information and communications technology more and
  more jobs come into existence that require an understanding of an interaction with
  software applications, computer systems, and especially Enterprise Resource Planning
  (ERP) systems. The accessibility of ERP systems should be a basic prerequisite,
  so that blind and partially sighted people can be successfully integrated into the
  labor market. However, on account of the complexity of these systems an efficient
  and satisfactory accessibility is very difficult to reach, and during interaction
  different barriers can appear. This work creates a guideline for the accessibility
  of ERP systems based on a combination and adaptation of existing knowledge from
  a detailed literature research, existing web accessibility guidelines, as well as,
  individual guidelines of business software manufacturers. In addition, based on
  the aforementioned literature and literature research, a qualitative analysis of
  the target group is carried out to collect data about existing problems for blind
  and partially sighted users, and to indicate weak spots in already existing accessibility
  solutions. The gathered and evaluated information from this study is in-cluded in
  this work, which in its entirety shows a literature-based comprehensive accessibility
  guideline. This guideline should be used for the development of ERP systems in order
  to make accessibility and usability of these systems more efficient and reduce barriers
  for blind and partially sighted users.
