### Topic

The project ERPEL targets at an e-business registry serving as a backbone for executing on-the-fly e-business transactions between semantically enabled ERP systems. By on-the-fly e-business transactions we understand transactions that are conducted between companies, which are not yet in a partnership and dynamically find each other in order to engage in e-business transactions. These business partners have to find each other according to both their business needs and technical capabilities. This is supported by the ERPEL registry. Today, registries are often successfully used within a company, but there are hardly any success stories on public registries to support B2B. One reason is that registry entries may not be considered trustworthy. In order to avoid fake entries, the ERPEL registry will reconcile data with business directories of legal authorities. Furthermore, companies usually do not trust other unknown companies. In order to foster trust in this context we build upon techniques known from social networks. Thereby, we aim at establishing business networks within the ERPEL registry. Finding an appropriate business partner, it is important to know her business capabilities or in other words which products she offers. Usually companies maintain their product portfolio in their ERP system, but hardly anyone is willing to maintain this portfolio in another data store, i.e., the registry. Thus, we develop a seamless integration of the product portfolios, held in the ERP systems of the project partners, into the ERPEL registry. In order to avoid a proliferation of different naming and descriptions of the same products, we apply semantic techniques for product classifications. A search in the registry has to disclose the technical capabilities of a potential business partner in order to ensure interoperability. Overloaded business document standards, missing process choreographies, and a variety of communication protocols hamper an effective search. Thus, ERPEL follows a bottom-up approach starting from core documents with well-defined extension mechanisms, and unambiguous business choreography specifications. Furthermore, ERPEL comes with a default communication protocol specifically targeting SMEs. These unambiguous specifications allow the development of business service interfaces (BSI) that are integrated into the ERP systems. BSIs guarantee the execution of e-business transactions between customers of different ERP systems.
