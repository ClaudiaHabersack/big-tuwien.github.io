abstract: 'IT systems'' integration in manufacturing companies is currently investigated
  in both academia and industry. While there can be found specialized systems and
  standards that tackle specific, e.g., production relevant problems, little has been
  done in the alignment of and transformation between such industrial standards. We
  will present the alignment of two specialized international standards, which will
  foster vertical system integration through detailed mapping of related concepts:
  (i) the Automation Markup Language (AML) standardizes the modeling of factory shop
  floors on top of the XML-based Computer Aided Engineering Exchange (CAEX) data format
  and (ii) ISA-95 is a series of standards targeting the integration of enterprise
  control systems, most prominent enterprise resource planning systems and manufacturing
  execution systems. In order to provide higher level semantics to lower level system
  descriptions, we have (i) aligned elements from AML and ISA-95 in order to make
  explicit both overlaps and complementary concepts and (ii) defined a ruleset for
  referencing external ISA-95 documents/elements from AML documents. Finally, we have
  developed a scenario that shows the potential use case for such an entwined use
  of AML and ISA-95.'
