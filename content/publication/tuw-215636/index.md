abstract: Capture the Flag (CTF) is an information warfare exercise, where participants
  compete against each other in teams and try to defend their own flags or attack
  the machines of the opposing teams to capture their flags. Points are scored if
  a machine is being hacked or defended successfully. The scenario is similar to an
  information warfare, also known by the term cyberwar. In this thesis, the use of
  CTF contests in university teaching is discussed. The first part of this work is
  a theoretical discourse and aims to backlight the development framework of the events.
  Herein also the form of learning is covered in its theory in order to discuss it
  in a more profound way. The practical part of the study includes several case examples
  that show how an effective use could be made. Furthermore, it is discussed how students
  prepare best for the competition to the sometimes very complex tasks. In addition,
  the resource-efficient use of the necessary hardware and software, such as the evaluation
  of these competitions, is illuminated. Finally, a guide with clear recommendations
  for the discharge of CTF contests in university teaching is given.
