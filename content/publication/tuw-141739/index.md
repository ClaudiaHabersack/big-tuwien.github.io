abstract: In recent years the need for business process model transformation has increased.
  The primary reason for this is the importance of business to business interopeability.
  A lot of research is done in this area Several transformation techniques exist in
  the field of MDA which is the model driven architecture as defined by Object Management
  Group (OMG).   In Business Process Modeling many modeling languages such as BPMN,
  activity diagrams, Event-Driven Process Chains et cetera are used. There is also
  a certain diversity in transformation techniques such as ATL, QVT or Kermeta. Most
  model transformation approaches focus on software development, and less in business
  processes. Therefore some approaches may be more or less suitable for this task
  than others.   In this master thesis, a transformation approach, namely Triple Graph
  Grammars will be inspected for its suitability in business process model transformation.
  Event-driven process chains and activity diagrams from UML 2.x are chosen as business
  process modeling languages because of the wide spread popularity of these languages.
  Fujaba will be used as transformation tool for its Triple Graph Grammar support
  and its extendibility.   In the thesis the business process modeling languages event-driven
  process chains and activity diagrams are described. Furthermore, several example
  models for event-driven process chains and activity diagrams are defined. In the
  practical part the goal is to develop  Fujaba plug-ins for those modeling languages,
  as well as to define the Triple Graph Grammars rules based on the new plug-ins.
  The example models will be needed to test if the Triple Graph Grammar rules are
  intend correctly.   Fujaba is an open source project from the University of Paderborn.
  Its primary topic is to provide an extendable platform for UML, Story Driven Modeling
  and Graph Transformation platform with the ability to add plug-ins. In the master
  thesis this tool is used because of its mature Triple Graph Grammar support Another
  reason is its extensibility which is useful for creating custom plug-ins for event-driven
  process chains and activity diagrams.   The plug-ins are developed with Java and
  rely on the meta models of Activity diagrams and Event-driven process chains. The
  prepared meta models are also used when defining the Triple Graph Grammar rules
  as initial point. The meta models and the transformation are focused on control
  flow of business processes, because of its central importance in business process
  modeling. Organizational flow is also included as a secondary view.   In order to
  make a statement on how suitable the described approach is, a list of criteria is
  defined. Based on this criteria business process model transformation with triple
  graph grammars will be evaluated.
