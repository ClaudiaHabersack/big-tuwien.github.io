I studied Software Engineering for Business and Finance at the Upper Austrian University of Applied Science in Hagenberg (FH Hagenberg) from 2001 to 2005. During my study, I did my internship as well as my diploma thesis at the Siemens Corporate Technology Research Department in Munich focusing on Model-Driven Software Development. From 2005 to 2009 I worked at the R&amp;D department of the FH Hagenberg. Since March 2009 I am working at the Business Informatics Group as project assistant in the TROPIC project focusing on model transformations.
