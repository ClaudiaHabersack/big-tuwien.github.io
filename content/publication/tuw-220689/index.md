abstract: Business document standards usually cover a hierarchical structure of thousands
  of elements that may be relevant in any business context (any industry, any geopolitical
  region, etc.). In order to use a business document standard in a specific context,
  user groups define so-called implementation guidelines based on a subset consisting
  usually of 3-5% of the overall elements. When one defines a new implementation guideline
  for a specific context, one has always to start from scratch, which is time-consuming
  and also leads to heterogeneous interpretations of the standard. It is our goal
  to speed up the development process and to create more homogeneous implementation
  guidelines by learning from existing models. In the previous phases of our research
  we have developed the Enhanced Unified Context (E-UCM) model to represent business
  context. If we could assign instances of this model to already existing business
  document implementation guidelines, we may guess the subset of a new implementation
  guideline for a required BC. Accordingly, this paper describes our approach to calculate
  the content model (subset) of a message implementation guideline which is relevant
  in a required BC presented by the E-UCM context model.
