### Topic

The Austrian e-billing standard ebInterface has been supported by major Austrian ERP-vendors. Thus, the XML-based ebInterface standard may be used in Austria to exchange invoices by electronic means. New expertise in daily use led to new standard requirements which should be taken into account. In some branches the standard has to be adapted without changing the kernel of the standard. The general Plug-Ins should be replaced by a well-defined methodology. The EU project PEPPOL is working on a solution for the public sector on basis of the Universal Business Language (UBL). As a partner of the PEPPOL Project the Bundesrechenzentrum GmbH is developing a transformation between ebInterface and UBL Invoice. This transformation has to be evaluated to enable the Bundesrechenzentrum GmbH wether the transformation can be reccomended to KMUs or not.
