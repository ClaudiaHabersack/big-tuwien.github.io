abstract: A financial patent valuation is only as good as the estima-  tions behind
  it. For start-up companies and young entrepre-  neurs in particular, patents usually
  play a major role in finding  possible investors to finance the future commercialisation
  of  the innovative product covered by the patent. At the same  time, investors need
  to economically valuate the potential of  the patent by using an easily and quickly
  adaptable method, in  order to make the right decisions for their investments. The  new
  valuation method presented here is specially customised  for patents in start-up
  companies or for patents owned by en-  trepreneurs; it provides an easy calculation
  method combined  with a qualitative valuation method, to be applied both to the  patent
  itself and to its future commercialisation in possible  markets. In four steps (combined
  with provided templates),  the patents can be financially valuated, with comparatively  little
  effort and low costs.
