abstract: As a result of the ever increasing functional and technical complexity the
  established methods for managing the IT-enterprise-architecture in the Austrian
  Justice encounter to their limits. Therefore the objective of this thesis is to
  examine the potential for new methods and tools based on The Open Group Architecture
  Framework (TOGAF). For this purpose, the different elements of TOGAF were analyzed
  and investigated corresponding application scenarios in the justice department.
  In order to this the special requirements which result from (constitutional) legal
  frameworks, such as the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers
  of mod-ern democracy or the ICT-Consolidation Act were taken into account. In particular
  it was investigated to what extent the TOGAF framework can assist these challenges,
  and which methods of the framework may require special adaptations. The first part
  of the thesis gives a detailed theoretical overview of the subject areas of e-government,
  e-governance and e-justice, and made a distinction between the terms. The second
  part is devoted to the theoretical examination of the subject of enterprise architecture
  management as well as of related frameworks. After a summary of the main characteristics
  of TOGAF, the status quo of the Austrian e-government organization and the existing
  enterprise architecture management in the Austrian justice department is analyzed.
  The identified optimization potentials are compared with solution proposals from
  the TOGAF framework. The suggested solutions are described in terms of their organization
  specific adaption and further summarized into work packages. These work packages
  are assembled to a roadmap for an upgrade of the justice enterprise architecture
  management. The last part of the thesis contains a curriculum that offers a framework
  for an accompanying training which can also be used as a foundation for a long-term
  educational strategy.
