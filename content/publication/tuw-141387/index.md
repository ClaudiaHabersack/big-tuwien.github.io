abstract: In a B2B environment business partners interact with each other by exchanging
  electronic business documents. The agreements and commitments between the partner
  require a certain order in the flow of business documents. This flow - commonly
  known as choreography - often depends on the actual content of a business document.
  E.g. the next step depends on whether a price was stated in a quote document or
  not in the step before. These characteristics usually affect the states of a business
  entity - whether a quote is in state provided or in state refused. The states of
  a business entity usually define the next steps in the choreography of a collaborative
  business process. Thus, it is important that the actual business document content
  and resulting business entity states are unambiguously defined in a global choreography.
  In this paper we show how the modeling of business entity state centric choreographies
  may be incorporated into UN/CEFACTÂ´s modeling methodology (UMM) - one of the best
  known approaches to model global choreographies.
