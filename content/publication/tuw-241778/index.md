abstract: The large scale of the Internet has offered unique economic opportunities,
  that in turn introduce overwhelming challenges for development and operations to
  provide reliable and fast services in order to meet the high demands on the performance
  of online services. In this paper, we investigate how performance engineers can
  identify three different classes of externally-visible performance problems (global
  delays, partial delays, periodic delays) from concrete traces. We develop a simulation
  model based on a taxonomy of root causes in server performance degradation. Within
  an experimental setup, we obtain results through synthetic monitoring of a target
  Web service, and observe changes in Web performance over time through exploratory
  visual analysis and changepoint detection. We extend our analysis and apply our
  methods to real-user monitoring (RUM) data. In a use case study, we discuss how
  our underlying model can be applied to real performance data gathered from a multinational,
  high-traffic website in the financial sector. Finally, we interpret our findings
  and discuss various challenges and pitfalls.
