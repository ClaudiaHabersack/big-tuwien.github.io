abstract: The development of inter-organizational systems requires a well defined
  development process. UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology (UMM) provides such a development
  process. We served as the editing team of the UMM 1.0 foundation module, which is
  defined as a UML profile. First experiences of applying UMM in real world projects
  have disclosed some limitations. Accordingly, we propose integrating new concepts
  into a new version 2.0 of UMM. In this paper, we show the adapted UMM development
  process, which is demonstrated by means of a waste management example.
