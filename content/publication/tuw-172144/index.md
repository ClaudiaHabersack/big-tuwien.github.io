abstract: This paper concentrates on premises and functionalities of IT Management
  software especially in the area of SAP system monitoring to ensure a proper working
  of the IT systems. As a first step a catalogue of requirements is created. This
  catalogue is based on in-house and international (security) standards. The main
  question of this thesis analyses if the functionality of the SAP Solution Manager
  from the SAP AG is an independent system monitoring solution for SAP systems. Based
  on case studies of an IT outsourcer it is discussed if the SAP Solution Manager
  is an additional or a compensating solution compared to other products on the market.
  Furthermore , the comparison of the different IT Management software products is
  presented in table form. Finally, it is shown that the SAP Solution Manager assumes
  an important role for SAP system management. However, the advantages compared to
  its competitors are just in a small area.
