abstract: 'Sophisticated business rule engines provide a way to enable users with
  a non-software-engineering background to take action during the runtime of e.g.
  an enterprise information system: rules for customers can be defined, based on the
  turnover realized through them. The REA accounting model defines a concept for the
  modeling and excecution of business models, yet it does not go into detail how to
  implement and integrate business rules. We propose the integration of a proven business
  rule engine in contrast to the definition of a REA specific rule language or model
  by defining a set of anchor points into which specific business rules can be hooked
  that are fired when these anchor points are reached.'
