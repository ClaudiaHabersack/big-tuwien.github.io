abstract: Agile processes potentially ease distributed software development by demanding
  regular communication and self-management of virtual team members. However, being
  designed for collocated teams, extensions to the regular process need to be made.
  We investigate critical areas of improvement based on a case of distributed Scrum
  involving two unaffiliated Austrian IT organizations that collaborate to build software.
  We identified eight critical areas for improvement originating from interviews,
  retrospective meetings and an in-depth case analysis. Key suggestions for practice
  include the establishment of long-lived single-site Scrum teams and the application
  of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) to make implicit requirement knowledge explicit
  and transparent to all of the distributed parties.
