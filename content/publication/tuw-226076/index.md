abstract: The number of Voice over IP systems and the number of Session Initiation
  Protocol users is constantly increasing. The new Voice over IP infrastructures are
  connected with the traditional Public Switched Telephone Network and attacks against
  the phone infrastructure are becoming more imaginative. The attacks can cause financial
  losses, e.g., attackers steal money or incur costs for the victim. We analyze the
  current status of toll fraud attacks by analyzing real-world attacks collected in
  a Voice over IP honeynet solution. Based on the detailed data about real attacks,
  the creation or adaption of existing prevention mechanisms is possible in order
  to avoid toll fraud attacks in live environments.
