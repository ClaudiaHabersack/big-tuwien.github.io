abstract: According to the topic of this master thesis you will get to know about
  the introduction and the profit of IT-Management within an Austrian leasing enterprise.
  During the theory you will get information about the standard methods of IT-Management
  as well as some of the most important models, which will show comparison of the
  different concepts. The main aspect here is IT infrastructure library (ITIL) Version
  2, which is a common standard and was planned to being used in the described case
  study. The second part, the so called case study is related to an Austrian enterprise
  the BAWAG P.S.K. Leasing. This enterprise will be introduced to you, which contains
  the history, the structure, the main business areas, the structure of the internal
  IT-department as well as the current situation and status. The main focus lies on
  the research of the problem fields in the IT-department. Later you will read about
  why and how the introduction of IT-Management should be done and which benefits
  the enterprise could capitalise. In a risk-analysis aspects about how the introduction
  of IT-management could be constrained or even completely cutted off will be shown
  as well as aspects which could reduce the benefit so much, that the goals could
  not be reached.
