abstract: Software is commonly tested before release in order to be able to meet certain
  quality standards of the final product. Test automation promises to lower the number
  of repetitious tasks for testers and reduce expenses for testing. However, the introduction
  of automated testing is not always beneficial. Some dangers are increased one-time
  costs to implement the automation framework at the beginning, and that test automation
  is thought to be able to replace all manual tasks. Test case generation is one of
  the possibilities to use automation in a software project in order to potentially
  reduce costs and improve quality. A solution that generates test cases and gives
  stakeholders an estimation of software quality could be used to improve the testing
  process as well as existing test cases. Within the scope of a case study, a proof-of-concept
  prototype software to generate test data was developed. The generated test cases
  were used for testing multiple parts of a software that were written in various
  programming languages. The comparison of both sets of test cases showed that some
  existing test cases could not be replaced by their automated counterparts, but also
  that the generated test cases tested new parts of the software and can be executed
  much more often. It has been found that the generated test cases can be used to
  estimate many software quality factors like accuracy, stability and fault tolerance.
  From the results it has been deducted that software quality is composed of numerous
  factors, some of which are hard to test for only by generating test cases. The main
  strengths of auto-mated test case generation lie in testing for correctness and
  robustness. For quality factors like installability, additional research may be
  conducted in order to extend the approach and to be able to assess even more quality
  factors. In general, the solution of generating test cases seems to be most beneficial
  for complex interfaces with a large number of methods and parameters.
