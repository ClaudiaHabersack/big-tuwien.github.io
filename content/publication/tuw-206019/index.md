abstract: Mobile communication has changed our lives rapidly over the last two decades.
  Our society's demands are changing from "permanently available" to "constantly informed"
  and "always up-to date". Over 99% of the Austrian students in secondary education
  already have some kind of mobile phone at their disposal. Due to the rapid change
  of models and the high esteem held by smart phones among students, in a few years
  nearly everybody will have a de-vice of this class. Many students and teaching staff
  are reflecting on how to use the medium mobile phone as a tool to support learning
  as well as teaching. Thus on the one hand the potential of these devices that are
  already available could be used meaningfully and on the other hand the learner's
  competent use of media - for many a core competence of the 21st century - could
  be enhanced. In the course of a two-year study a set of mobile didactic methods
  (MDM) was devel-oped. The MDMs support the meaningful use of mobile technology and
  are optimized with regards to their application in secondary education. A selection
  of various methods was tested in partner schools in the Vienna area in real teaching
  situations. From the observations of the participants, the written questionnaires
  in the course of these tests and the complimentary interviews conducted with the
  students, a number of chances, but also several problems, which are to be encountered
  when using smart phones in teaching, were discovered. Based on the results of this
  empirical study, the potentials and the limitations of this medium are evaluated
  and guidelines are presented, which can be utilized for the suc-cessful introduction
  of the medium mobile phone in teaching.
