abstract: The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the uninterrupted use
  of digital construction models from the planning stage onwards. As the operation
  phase approaches, the involved processes become increasingly complex. Stakeholders
  work at varying pace and utilize highly specialized tool chains that need to communicate
  seamlessly with each other. BIM aims to satisfy those needs. However, even the most
  extensive Open BIM standard - IFC- does not provide the necessary data structure,
  in spite of its more than one thousand different types, because its focus is the
  planning phase. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC, consists of less than
  50 different basic types. They can be dynamically combined to increasingly complex
  models, which can themselves be used as prototypes for other models. This enables
  each domain expert to create custom data structures for any specific task, which
  are automatically compatible with data structures of other stakeholders. In this
  way, unlike IFC, our data model removes the long wait for the next implementation
  cycle to be completed by developers. Furthermore, it shortens the training time
  and facilitates the loss-, corruption-, and conflict-free exchange of information
  between domain experts, which is a key aspect of BIM. As proof of concept, we present
  the evolution of the virtual building model from the construction to the operation
  phase. In each phase, stakeholders enrich the data model with the information they
  need for, e.g., analyses. Our approach considers the needs of the operation phase
  and works towards the construction and commissioning phases to set up the necessary
  data infrastructure by collecting information at every stage, from every stakeholder
  and considering inter - dependencies, potential conflicts and threats to model consistency.
  Results show that the flexible data model of SIMULTAN can be adapted to the task.
  It can handle structured as well as unstructured data.
