abstract: A Business Activity Monitoring System is one way to evaluate the Vendor
  Managed Inventory approach within a virtual organization. Vendor Managed Inventory
  deals with the assessment of demand controlled by the supplier. Business Activity
  Monitoring Systems measure and monitor business processes using defined key performance
  indicators. They provide insight into the status of business processes as well as
  decision guidance for process optimization and weakness detection. Realizing a Business
  Activity Monitoring System for a virtual organization is especially challenging
  because it has to integrate business and technical requirements for more than one
  company. The main business requirement is to monitor key performance indicators
  in real time for all participants. Therefore, it is necessary to define consistent
  and significant key performance indicators. Saving data on a regular basis ensures
  the analyzation of historical data. Firstly, monitoring helps to identify deviations
  from normal conditions and secondly, it supports the user in making decisions. Notifications
  need to be sent to the user when key performance indicators reach critical values.
  As virtual organizations tend to be dynamic in their partnership, it is necessary
  to be able to integrate new companies easily and inexpensively. Business Activity
  Monitoring Systems for a virtual organization needs to fulfill technical requirements
  such as transferring automated and manual data at any time, calculating key performance
  indicators through defined algorithm, collecting and saving data on a regular basis,
  noticing thresholds, representing key performance indicators clearly, sending notifications
  and the system should be scalable enough to integrate new companies. Standardized
  interfaces are necessary in order to import different data from various companies.
  This helps to facilitate the integration of new companies into the virtual organization.
