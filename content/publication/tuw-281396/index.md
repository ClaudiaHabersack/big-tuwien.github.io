abstract: AutomationML provides a versatile modeling environment for the description
  of production systems. However, when starting a new AutomationML project, or when
  serializing existing data with the AutomationML format, there are no rules on how
  to structure these models in a meaningful way. In this work, we present an approach
  for structuring AutomationML models, based on the IEC 62264 standard. In our approach
  we are implementing the process of serializing IEC 62264 information declaratively,
  by leveraging the power of model transformations, as they are applied in the context
  of model-driven (software) engineering.
