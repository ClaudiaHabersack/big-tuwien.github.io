abstract: When linked data applications communicate, they commonly use messaging technologies
  in which the message exchange itself is not represented as linked data, since it
  takes place on a different architectural level. When a message cannot be verified
  and traced on the linked data level, trust in data is moved from message originators
  to service providers. However, there are use cases in which the actual message exchange
  and its verifiability are of importance. In such situations, the separation between
  application data and communication data is not desirable. To address this, we propose
  messaging based on linked data, where communicating entities and their messages
  are represented as interconnected Web resources, and we show how conversations can
  be made verifiable using digital signatures.
