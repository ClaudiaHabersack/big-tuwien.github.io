abstract: The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Commerce
  provides a conceptual approach named Core Components for defining business document
  models based on reusable building blocks. For the application in concrete business
  scenarios, these building blocks need customizing, resulting in different variants
  of business document models. In previous work we have proven the application of
  concepts from Model-Driven Product Line Engineering to manage the resulting business
  document model variants. However, due to the highly dynamic environment of electronic
  commerce with ever-changing market requirements, business document models evolve
  over time. This adds another dimension of variability to the problem domain leading
  to complex evolution scenarios. In this paper, we define evolution patterns for
  capturing the different types of evolution present in the context of business document
  model variants. Having such patterns at hand, makes the different types of evolution
  in business document models more tangible.
