abstract: Security situation in the world drastically changed in the last few decades.
  Terrorism, illegal immigration, identification theft and documents falsification
  urged for new solutions in order for government to protect their citizens. National
  identification seemed to be an ideal solution for many governments. Personal identity
  cards and electronic passports are typical products of such projects. The different
  methods and mechanisms used for this purpose are strongly controversial and disputed
  among different interest groups. The main questions are, to which degree should
  the gov-ernment obtain control of personal data, for how long should this information
  be stored and maybe the most important, who will gain access to these highly sensitive
  data. Another discussion point is the technology used in order to achieve certain
  re-sults. Technology improves by the day but is it really fully developed to satisfy
  both interested parties, namely government and citizens? Based on a case study on
  a Na-tional ID project in Republic of Croatia, this thesis shows a concrete solution
  to all these issues and discusses different points of view.
