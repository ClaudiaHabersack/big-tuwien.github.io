abstract: 'Within the scope of this thesis, the current field of research on the electronic
  health records was studied. There are several different solutions introduced to
  the market every year. While many hospitals and other medical institutions have
  been using some sort of electronic documentation for many decades, nowadays the
  established infrastructure does not seem to be adequate anymore. Storing a record
  on a computer and then giving a printout to another doctor when the need arises,
  cannot be considered as an electronic exchange of data. There is a strong demand
  for a coordinated national effort to ensure exchange of data among different hospitals
  and institutions in a country. The aim of the presented thesis is to compare nationwide
  implementation projects of electronic health record systems in three different countries:
  USA, Denmark and England. As a result of this thesis, all relevant criteria were
  clearly summarized in a table, building a basis for further comparison of any country
  with the intention to introduce a comprehensive and national electronic health system.'
