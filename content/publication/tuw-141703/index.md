abstract: In the context of this diploma thesis test case generation tools were comparatively
  ana-lyzed. It showed up that even well suitable test methods, which generate efficient
  tests with a small number of test cases are not far common nowadays. The central
  question of this thesis is, to examine if the integration of existing test case
  design methods into an established tool can increase the spreading degree of these
  tools, and thus to a general improvement within the range of the test case generation
  can contribute. As a concrete case study of the existing test case generation tool
  IDATG (= "Integrating Design and Automated test Case generation") of the Siemens
  AG was consulted and the improvement potential was analyzed in detail. On one hand
  the number of test cases shall be reduced and the quality of the generated test
  cases shall be improved, and on the other hand the effectiveness of the error identification
  shall be optimized. IDATG is able to generate complete test cases from test scenarios,
  which are repre-sented as a graph with nodes and edges. A large number of data variations
  increase the amount of test cases extremely. To get along with few very effective
  test cases new methods have to be used. To reach this goal the equivalence class
  method and the boundary value analysis were implemented. Thus it is also ensured
  that the execution time of a test cycle is minimized. As a result of the systematic
  procedure of the equivalence class method it is possible to test all input variables
  and their value ranges. By using the boundary value analysis method the quality
  of the test cases can be further improved, because software errors occur most frequently
  at the boundaries. Based on the results of the analyses as central improvement the
  flow control of the IDATG was separated from the integration of the new test methods,
  which make the test data available for the test case generation process, in order
  to avoid compatibility prob-lems. In the context of this thesis new test methods
  were implemented in a separate module. It was made certain that the newly created
  dialogs and functions for the specification and generation of the test data do not
  interfere with other existing parts of IDATG to ensure backward compatibility. Finally
  an evaluation was planned, where the focus was put on the Usability of the new dialogues
  and the quality and the number of the generated test cases.
