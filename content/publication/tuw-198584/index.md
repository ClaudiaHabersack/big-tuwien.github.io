abstract: Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the domain of exchanging business documents
  in a structured format. Nowadays, these systems take more and more advantage of
  service-oriented solutions. Nevertheless, a rigorous approach to customize the input
  and output messages of these services to the context of a business partnership is
  required. In this paper we suggest a model-driven approach to develop the XML Schemas
  of input and output messages of Web Services. Since classical data modeling approaches
  like regular UML class diagrams are not sufficient for modeling business documents,
  we base our approach on the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS),
  which does not come with a presentation syntax. Thus, we deliver a UML profile extending
  class diagrams by CCTS concepts, called UML Profile for Core Components (UPCC).
  UPCC models are transferred to equivalent XML Schemas following well-defined naming
  and design rules. In order to allow for an easy search and retrieval of core component
  business document definitions, a registry is needed. The registry has to handle
  UPCC models - that are exchanged and stored in XMI - as well as their XML Schema
  equivalences. In this paper, we extend the ebRIM registry meta model for the special
  purpose of registering core component artifacts and defining their inter-dependencies.
