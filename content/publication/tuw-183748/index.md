abstract: Code reviews are a method to assure quality in software projects. Although
  their efficiency has been confirmed by a lot of studies, they are still considered
  a cost and time intensive necessity for the improvement of product quality. In fact
  formal review methods like software inspection and walk-through requires a considerable
  amount of resources for the planning and execution of the individual review phases.
  Less formal review methods are more lightweight, so they are easier to adapt to
  special needs in software projects. Furthermore reviewers can focus on the most
  important task of code reviews - inspecting the source code. This thesis presents
  the concept of a lightweight review process using the revision control system for
  the execution of code reviews. Unlike traditional review methods where the review
  scope is determined by the review manager, the source code under review equals to
  a changeset in the versioning system. The code changes within a changeset are highly
  interdependent, thus the reviewer may understand the code modifications in a more
  easier manner. Based on author-reviewer assignments the code reviews are created
  automatically by the review system and can be executed continuously. The initial
  adoption and planning of the reviews requires minimal time. All review data is stored
  within files and shared with the revision control system. So there is no need to
  setup any server-side application. Based on the introduced concept a prototype for
  the integrated development environment Eclipse has been implemented, which includes
  all requirements specified for the lightweight review process.
