abstract: In the development process of a B2B system, it is crucial that the business
  experts are able to express and evaluate agreements and commitments between the
  partners, and that the software engineers get all necessary information to bind
  the private process interfaces to the public ones. UN/CEFACT´s modeling methodology
  (UMM) is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for developing B2B processes.
  The formalisms introduced by UMM´s stereotypes facilitate the communication with
  the software engineers. However, business experts-who usually have a very limited
  understanding of UML-prefer expressing their thoughts and evaluating the results
  by plain text descriptions. In this paper,we describe an approach that presents
  an equivalent of theUMMstereotypes and tagged values in text-based templates called
  worksheets. This strong alignment allows an integration into a UMM modeling tool
  and ensures consistency. We show how a specially designed XML-based worksheet definition
  language allows customization to special needs of certain business domains. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate how information kept in worksheets may be used for the semi-automatic
  generation of pattern-based UMM artifacts which are later transformed to web service
  definition language and business process execution language code.
