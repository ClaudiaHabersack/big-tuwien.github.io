Performance is an important non-functional requirement and a key-characteristic of software systems. Software performance engineering (SPE), alongside a software engineering process, covers any activity related to performance management of software systems and highlights the importance of engineering principles instead of ad-hoc try and error approaches. However, SPE is split into two main areas: The model-based- and the measurement-based approach. With the rise of agile software development methodologies in the last decade, the importance of continuous delivery and thus the early provisioning of operations resources increased. Given the new possibilities that these concepts together with DevOps and Cloud solutions offer, it appears practically usable to combine the model-based approach with the measurement-based approach. The combination of these two approaches in SPE is the research interest of this thesis.
