abstract: Form-based user interfaces are an important design option for today&iquest;s
  software. Nonetheless, ongoing criticism regarding lack of interactive features,
  dullness, and bureaucracy indicates a need to improve the current design practice.
  The present dissertation addresses this need by providing theoretical and practical
  contributions for form design. The theoretical contributions of this work include
  an investigation of historical forms, a novel definition of today&iquest;s form-based
  user interfaces (UIs), and a systematic analysis of research goals. The definition
  is based on the concept of UI metaphor. Its main practical advantage is that it
  allows one to clearly distinguish constitutive characteristics from contingent ones.
  The definition is firmly grounded in a comprehensive review of related work and
  an investigation of historically time-invariant characteristics of forms. Implications
  of the definition were elaborated using semiotic theory of UI metaphor. This allowed
  to analyze metaphorical entailments and derive a list of fourteen research goals
  for future form design. In summary, the theory provided in this work clears the
  current confusion over defining characteristics of form-based UIs and can inspire
  future research in innovative form design. The practical part of this work addresses
  three research goals related to navigation, collaboration, and gamification in the
  context of form-based UIs. Contributions made regarding these three goals include
  analyses of available design options, proposals for novel form designs, and empirical
  evaluations of these designs. First, regarding navigation in long form-based UIs,
  this work applied the Focus&Context principle from information visualization to
  form design. The novel design was evaluated on desktop and mobile devices with promising
  results. Even novice users could easily work with the new design. An additional
  insight gained from the evaluation is that Scrolling should be avoided on mobile
  devices in favor of other design patterns that provide a better overview. Second,
  regarding collaboration, this work presents a design space analysis of available
  design options for designing collaborative form-filling. The analysis provided a
  basis for developing and proposing a rapid prototyping tool. The tool allows for
  quick configuration (instead of time-consuming implementation) of various design
  options and thus supports iterative design, comparative evaluations, and empirically-grounded
  design decisions. Third, hedonic qualities of form-based UIs and their much criticized
  dullness were addressed through gamification. Specifically, this work proposed a
  novel design process for gamifiying online surveys. The process was successfully
  employed in case studies. The resulting gamified survey designs significantly improved
  the respondents&iquest; user experiences. In summary, the theoretical and practical
  contributions of this work helped to advance the under- standing of form-based UIs
  and to evolve the current design practice towards more efficiency, interactivity,
  and towards a more pleasant user experience.
