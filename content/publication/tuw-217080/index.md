abstract: The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology is a powerful and well accepted
  approach towards the design of enterprise information systems in the academic world.
  However, it still lacks application in industry products. Software like ERP applications
  might benefit from REA data structure by building their product's core on a robust,
  economic theory based, business ontology. Consequently, we have lately started a
  feasibility study with an Austrian ERP vendor, in which we investigate whether or
  not the ERP vendor can use the REA ontology as basis for their new ERP system. This
  paper is aimed at raising questions about uncertainties in REA we came across in
  our study so far.
