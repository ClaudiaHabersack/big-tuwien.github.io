abstract: The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the continuous use of
  digital construction models from the planning stage onwards. The affected processes
  are iterative and involve multiple stakeholders who work at varying pace and in
  varying levels of detail. These stakeholders require highly specific tools based
  on diverging data models. To satisfy all those requirements one of the best known
  Open BIM implementations - IFC - offers a data model containing more than one thousand
  different types - from basic to highly specific. Due to its complexity, potential
  users must undergo prolonged training. The even bigger challenge for IFC, however,
  is keeping up with the updates of building regulations or with the ever expanding
  state of the art in simulation tools. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC,
  consists of approximately 30 different basic types. They can be combined to increasingly
  complex models, which can themselves be used as types for other models. This enables
  each domain expert to create a custom data structure for any specific task, which
  is automatically compatible with the data structure of any other domain expert using
  the same basic types. It shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-,
  and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key
  aspect of BIM. As a proof-of-concept we show the application of our data model in
  an ongoing project. We demonstrate the completeness of our data model and the fulfillment
  of the requirements of the design phase. The result shows that the flexible data
  model of SIMULTAN can be better adapted to the task. Another significant advantage
  of SIMULTAN is its inbuilt separation of responsibilities at the level of the most
  basic types, which, when combined with secure transaction technologies, can enable
  safe, effective and easily traceable interaction among stakeholders.
