abstract: Data retention is a controversial instrument of governments and their agencies
  with the background of fighting terrorism and crime. In 2006 the European Union
  (EU) passed the directive 2006/24/EC, which is about the retention of data generated
  or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications
  services, or of public communications networks. Based on the Austrian approach,
  this dissertation shows how it is possible for governments to implement a data retention
  system supporting authorities while taking into account a maximum protection of
  their citizens personal data and privacy. This system uses a centrally managed service
  to exchange necessary retention data between corresponding authorities and provider.
  The concept is based on strong cryptographic algorithms ensuring end-to-end encryption
  while enabling central monitoring and administration. Therefore it is in conformity
  with the directive as well as Austrian law and enforces a core aspect to guarantee
  citizens privacy.
