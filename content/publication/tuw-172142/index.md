abstract: A hospital information system (HIS) is a highly specialized type of enterprise
  information system. Its structure is aligned with the organization of the hospital
  in which it is being used. The main purpose of such an information system is to
  help relieve hospital personnel by increasing productivity and speeding up the flow
  of information within the enterprise. Other important tasks provided by the system
  involve support for both administrative as well as management personnel. This work
  summarizes the theoretical fundamentals of both general enterprise information systems
  and hospital information systems. The organizational structure of a hospital is
  explained by means of legal regulations. The basics of hospital management, divided
  between the hospital operator and the hospital administration, is outlined by describing
  the various tasks involved in running a hospital. The structure of the Humanomed
  Group is presented, and the hospitals operated by the Group are described and compared
  through their key data. The Humanomed Group's software infrastructure, particularly
  the hospital information system, is depicted from the viewpoint of software development.
  Furthermore, the interfaces of the HIS and the standards used are introduced. The
  reasons for the development of an individual hospital software and the decision
  processes involved are explained. This thesis is concluded with a brief discussion
  of future work to be conducted in the field.
