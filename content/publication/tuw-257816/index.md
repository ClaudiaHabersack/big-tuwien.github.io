abstract: 'Distributed software development (DSD) has become increasingly popular
  due to benefits such as cost savings, access to large multi-skilled workforces and
  a reduced time to market. Agile practices can potentially help increase transparency
  and mitigate communication and coordination issues in these complex environments.
  While empirical studies in the field exist, most are single-case studies that miss
  out on the chance to compare different distribution scenarios, which calls for further
  investigation. We report on results of a four-year exploratory multiple-case study
  investigating the agile process implementation in three different distribution scenarios:
  within-city, within-country and within-continent. We purposefully selected the three
  different cases and found ten common heuristics emerge which are based on empirical
  evidence in at least two cases as well as four further candidate heuristics that
  lack evidence in more than one case. In particular, the understanding of and adaptation
  to each development site''s inherent challenges, travelling ambassadors/proxies
  between sites, and a balanced distribution of decision makers proved to be important
  heuristics for a successful process implementation.'
