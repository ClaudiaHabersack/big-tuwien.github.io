abstract: Voice over IP (VoIP) gains more and more attractiveness by large companies
  as well as private users. Therefore, the risk increases that VoIP systems get attacked
  by hackers. In order to effectively protect VoIP users from misuse, researchers
  use, e.g., honeynets to capture and analyze VoIP attacks occurring in the Internet.
  Global VoIP security threats are analyzed by studying several millions of real-world
  attacks collected in independent VoIP honeynet solutions with different capture
  mechanisms over a long period of time. Due to the validation of results from several
  honeynet designs we have achieved a unique, much broader view on large scale attacks.
  The results show similar attacker behavior, confirm previous assumptions about attacks
  and present new insights in large scale VoIP attacks, e.g., for toll fraud.
