abstract: Voice over IP (VoIP) has gained widespread acceptance and is used for many
  business communications already. However, voice calls in traditional phone services,
  as well as in VoIP systems, have some security flaws and therefore can be easily
  intercepted, which can cause high damage by, e.g., industrial espionage. To establish
  secure and private phone calls, additional non-invasive measures are required to
  protect the signaling and voice channel between the parties for existing and well
  known VoIP applications. We propose an approach for secure and privacy sensitive
  VoIP communication by introducing an additional security layer. The introduced security
  layer can be applied to known VoIP solutions on different channels (e.g., soft phones
  or mobile phones) and is independent from the deployed VoIP implementation in order
  to improve security and privacy of VoIP calls for company systems.
