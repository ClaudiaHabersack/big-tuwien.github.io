abstract: We propose a user experience model that incorporates  interaction as an
  aesthetic quality and discuss the  impact of physical behavior on the perceived
  pragmatic  and hedonic quality of software. In an exploratory  study we evaluated
  the effect of physical behavior on  user experience.
