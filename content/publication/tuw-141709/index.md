abstract: 'Trade-offs or conflicts among client stakeholders about the Business Requirements
  of a new software product are a practical problem in complex software projects which
  is not widely covered by academic literature. Most sources in Software Engineering
  literature cover the "human factor" only with regard to teamwork in the project
  team, but similar effects on the client side are often neglected. Therefore this
  thesis examines the underlying problems and risks in Requirements Engineering and
  highlights, how Software Project Managers can face problems with adversarial client
  stakeholders. The conclusion provides a brief overview for Software Project Managers
  who face such trade-offs or conflicts: It supports them with "Contradictions that
  Software Project Management (SWPM) has to consider" as well as a Toolbox with possible
  measures. The major contributions of this thesis are the identification of an upcoming
  topic in Requirements Management and the related considerations about the nature
  of this problem and possible solutions.'
