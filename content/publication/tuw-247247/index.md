abstract: Trade transactions between companies usually require the exchange of business
  documents. When public administration is involved documents for certain reports
  have to be exchanged. In any case, these documents have to be exchange in some agreed
  order. Accordingly, the business document exchanges must be defined by a corresponding
  choreography. A choreography language for this purpose is delivered by the United
  Nation´s Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) which
  is an e-business standardization body known for its work on UN/EDIFACT and ebXML.
  The result - UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology (UMM) 2.0 - is presented in this chapter.
