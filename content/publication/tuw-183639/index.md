abstract: This issue's Works in Progress department lists eight projects with a focus
  on environmental sustainability. The first three projects explore sensing and pervasive
  computing techniques for monitoring environmental conditions in outdoor situations.
  The next four projects use pervasive computing in indoor environments to inform
  individuals about their energy and resource consumption with the goal of positively
  influencing their behaviors. The final project aims to develop an energy generation
  infrastructure that combines multiple types of renewable energy sources.
