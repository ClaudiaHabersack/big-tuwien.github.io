abstract: As a consequence of highly dynamic online markets and a strong competition
  one of the most important issues for online retailers is to strengthen customer
  loyalty and satisfaction. To achieve this goal, online shops implement new features
  which enable an intensive integration of all target groups. In addition the whole
  web is changing form a passive information spot to an interactive place where users
  can communicate and create their own content, summarized by the term "social web".
  Blogs, social networks or user generated media platforms demonstrate the broad range
  of such social sites. According to these phenomenons, classic e-shops are changing
  more and more to functional-rich communities with a strong consumer focus. This
  paper illustrates a model of a consumer centric community (CCC) which allows customers
  to collaborate within a social commerce environment. The developed model could be
  taken as basis for an adaption of existing e-stores or completely new shopping concepts.
  Especially for online vendors and owners of shopping communities the presented model
  will be relevant to target the demands of the "consumer 2.0", an active customer
  who wants to collaborate in a community-like shopping environment.
