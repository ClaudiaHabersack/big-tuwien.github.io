abstract: A multitude of research works on surveys dealing with ontology reuse point
  to a discrepancy between ontology engineers and users when interpreting the meaning
  of ontology concepts. Missing the engineers' knowledge of the concepts' usage in
  certain contexts may lead to problems (e.g., pragmatic heterogeneity) in the interpretation
  task caused by the lack of the users' capability to comprehend design decisions
  (i.e., what they have in mind when describing a domain of interest). The intended
  use of concepts has a great impact on their interpretation. Therefore, we assume
  that meaning interpretation involves more than merely identifying the semantics
  of assumptions explicitly expressed by model theory-based techniques, since meaning
  depends on both semantics and pragmatics. For this purpose, we introduce a pragmatic-based
  approach for implementing an evidence-based (unidirectional) communication model
  from engineers to users, which is mainly influenced by the relevance-based inferential
  model of verbal communication.
