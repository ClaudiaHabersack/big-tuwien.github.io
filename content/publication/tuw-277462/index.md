abstract: In the course of this thesis the prototype of a serious game has been developed
  that should motivate people, who don´t exercise sufficiently, to increase their
  physical activity. First of all, a comprehensive literature research examines the
  health-related benefits of physical activity as well as theories regarding behaviour
  change and motivation in general. A quantitative online research was conducted to
  analyse exercise habits along with expectations and reservations towards fitness
  apps. On this basis, requirements were identified and validated by the iterative
  development of a prototype in a User Centered Design process. The resulting survival
  role-playing game Walk the Isle uses permanent and comprehensive tracking which
  opens manifold opportunities to increase motivation for physical activity. Its focus
  lies on a story which consists of daily quests that can be finished by achieving
  a personal, adaptive step target. Items, that are discovered during such a quest,
  and notifications in case of inactivity should create an awareness for physical
  activity. Additionally, Walk the Isle features classic motivating game elements
  like achievements, collectibles and a levelling system. The prototype was well received
  in the concluding evaluation, especially because of its low barrier to entry. Apart
  from the smartphone, which runs the app, no additional devices are needed. Physical
  activity needed for finishing quests was perceived as negligible, as the story was
  consid- ered the main focus. The use of instantaneous feedback resulted in a gain
  of consciousness for physical activity and motivated the probands to increase their
  physical activity.
