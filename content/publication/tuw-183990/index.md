abstract: Workflow technology promises an increase in<br> efficiency in the execution
  of business processes. The<br> technology is widely accepted, but often the high
  costs exceed<br> the promised benefits. Thus, it is desirable to calculate the<br>
  profitability prior to investing into workflow technology. After<br> an investment
  into workflow management systems (WFMS), it<br> has to be verified whether the expected
  benefits have been<br> realized or not. In this paper we present a method that covers<br>
  both, the cost-benefit-ratio calculations specially customized<br> for WFMS and
  the calculation of the realized savings. The<br> profitability analysis is based
  on simple measurable<br> performance indicators that consider the tangible calculation<br>
  of costs as well as the quantitative and qualitative benefits.<br> Long time practical
  experience in implementing and operating<br> workflow management supported the design
  of the method.<br> The method presented in this paper has been successfully used<br>
  in the IT company of a banking corporation.
