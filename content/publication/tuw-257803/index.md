abstract: 'Developing software in distributed environments is more complex as communication,
  coordination and control challenges arise. Adaptations to process models for collocated
  teams become necessary. There has been a growing interest in the past years in transferring
  agile values to distributed software development (DSD) to mitigate those challenges.
  However, while there are numerous empirical studies that report successful applications,
  there is to date no process framework providing a holistic approach for implementing
  agile practices in DSD environments. This thesis strives to fill that research gap
  by creating the ADAPT (Agile Distributed Adaptable Process Toolkit) framework. The
  design theory behind the framework includes five testable propositions to describe
  the nature of ADAPT. Related work is systematically analyzed in a mapping study,
  covering the 15-year time span of 1999 to 2014. The mapping study shows that - although
  the research field matured - empirical context of a case is rarely described to
  a full extent. This finding calls for a checklist to report empirical context in
  agile DSD. Based on the mapping study, a checklist is designed and then applied
  to drive the data extraction in this thesis&iquest; multiple-case study, which features
  three cases of varying distribution scenarios: cross town, no timeshift and continental.
  Using a grounded theory approach, 49 guidelines and 94 practice candidates are extracted
  in total from single-case analysis. These candidates are then compared cross-case
  to see common patterns emerge, which results in 10 guidelines and 29 full practices
  as well as 7 conceptual practices, together forming the first full iteration of
  the ADAPT framework as the output of this thesis. Two focus groups and ten expert
  interviews are held to evaluate both the design and the resulting ADAPT framework.
  Experts agree that the current state of the framework contributes to the grand challenge
  of applying agile values to DSD, and that it is worthwhile to continue with further
  iterations of the framework in future work, both growing the empirical basis and
  testing the current utility of the framework in a real-world implementation study.'
