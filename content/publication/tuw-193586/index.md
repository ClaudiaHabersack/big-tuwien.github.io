abstract: In this paper we present results from contextual interviews and observations,
  which we conducted in Tanzania over a period of six weeks. In our interviews we
  focused on use cases and benefits that the mobile phone introduced in these areas.
  Specifically we were interested in the impact of mobile ICTs on social networks
  in general and communication with friends and family in particular. The goal of
  the study was to identify potential areas where ICTs could improve people's lives.
  Based on an analysis of the results from this study we created personas, which describe
  archetype mobile phone users and their respective needs and goals. The paper concludes
  with a number of directions for further research in this area.
