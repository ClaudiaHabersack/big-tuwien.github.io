abstract: With the recent advances in mobile technology, mobile devices have emerged
  from a luxury to a necessity in our lives. Especially the ability to be connected
  anytime and anywhere has become essential to a majority of smartphone users. As
  a consequence the mobile market is flourishing. The popularity of smartphones and
  tablets has increased the demand for high quality software in this area. In order
  to survive is this competitive market the use of software process models is advised.
  In recent years agile and lean methodologies have become very popular for the development
  of software, but there has only been little research about the applicability of
  these methods in the area of mobile applications. Therefore this master thesis aims
  to investigate the impact of agile and lean concepts in the field of mobile software
  development. In order to achieve that, the author proposes a new process model called
  ALP-Mobile (Agile and Lean Process for Mobile Application Development) which is
  a combination of scrum, kanban and extreme programming (XP). The introduced concept,
  in which fixed iterations in the development are waived, increases the flexibility
  of ALP-Mobile and furthermore helps to adapt to the fast pace of the mobile market.
  Practical experiences in the field of mobile application development are gathered
  in course of a case study executed within this research. Due to the conduct of qualitative
  interviews with experts in this area, the author is able to derive strengths and
  weaknesses of ALP-Mobile. The positive feedback received during the interviews is
  a first indicator that ALP-Mobile can bring real value to organizations working
  in the area of mobile application development.
