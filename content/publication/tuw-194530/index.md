abstract: The topic of Green IT is concerned with the efficient use of computing resources
  to reduce environmental impact and serves as a contribution to climate protection.
  In addition to environmental aspects (social responsibility), the resulting cost
  savings are mainly responsible for implementing energy efficiency measures. Due
  to the rising global electricity consumption, metrics that measure energy efficiency
  in the data center (PUE, DCE) have become necessary. Since the costs of cooling
  in the data center can be up to 50 percent of the total data center operating costs,
  there will be an investigative focus on different cooling scenarios and models.
  The recommendation for the lifting of the maximum inlet temperature up to 27 °C
  is only one discernible trend towards energy conservation. In a sense, the "green
  data center" can both reduce costs and simultaneously achieve reduced CO2 emissions
  through consolidation and virtualization. The thermal analysis is a scientific method
  for predicting air flows and temperatures. With its help, best practices in the
  data center design are developed, analyzed and optimized. In the thermal analysis
  of room and rack oriented data centers, the aim is to improve the cooling efficiency
  in the data center, to identify "hot spots" and to not exceed a defined inlet temperature.
  In the context of a case study a practical standard architecture of a data center
  is used to create a thermal analysis using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Thus,
  the standard architecture is explored and adjusted by means of knowledge as elaborated
  in the theoretical part to maximize efficiency in the data center. Through the results
  of thermal analysis, both in room and row oriented architecture, a saving of just
  under 50 percent could be achieved.
