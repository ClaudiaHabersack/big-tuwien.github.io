abstract: This chapter concentrates on the modeling and analysis of enterprises that
  collaborate in a service oriented world. According to the idea of model-driven development,
  modeling of service-oriented enterprises collaborating in a networked configuration
  must address three different layers. The first layer is concerned with business
  models that describe the exchange of economic values among the business partners.
  An appropriate methodology on this level of abstraction is e3-value [1, 2]. The
  second layer addresses the inter-organizational business processes among business
  partners. The third layer addresses the businesses processes executed at each partnerÂ´s
  side, i.e., what each partner implements locally to contribute to the business collaboration.
