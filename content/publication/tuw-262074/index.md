abstract: 'Many model transformation scenarios require flexible execution strategies
  as they should produce models with the highest possible quality. At the same time,
  transformation problems often span a very large search space with respect to possible
  transformation results. Recently, different proposals for finding good transformation
  results without enumerating the complete search space have been proposed by using
  meta-heuristic search algorithms. However, determining the impact of the different
  kinds of search algorithms, such as local search or global search, on the transformation
  results is still an open research topic. In this paper, we present an extension
  to MOMoT, which is a search-based model transformation tool, for supporting not
  only global searchers for model transformation orchestrations, but also local ones.
  This leads to a model transformation framework that allows as the first of its kind
  multi-objective local and global search. By this, the advantages and disadvantages
  of global and local search for model transformation orchestration can be evaluated.
  This is done in a case-study-based evaluation, which compares different performance
  aspects of the local- and global-search algorithms available in MOMoT. Several interesting
  conclusions have been drawn from the evaluation: (1) local-search algorithms perform
  reasonable well with respect to both the search exploration and the execution time
  for small input models, (2) for bigger input models, their execution time can be
  similar to those of global-search algorithms, but global-search algorithms tend
  to outperform local-search algorithms in terms of search exploration, (3) evolutionary
  algorithms show limitations in situations where single changes of the solution can
  have a significant impact on the solutionÂ´s fitness.'
