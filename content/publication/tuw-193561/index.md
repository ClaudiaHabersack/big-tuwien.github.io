abstract: This work presents an experience report on the evolutionary  development
  of a software product line (SPL) in the eHealth  domain. The e&#64256;ort was triggered
  by the concurrent devel-  opment of two similar products and the ambition to reduce  redundant
  development and quality assurance. The result is  a scalable base for a complex,
  highly adaptable information  system. This system is required to be applicable in
  multiple  business domains and diverging environments ranging from  large scale
  hospitals to single practitioner clinics.  During this e&#64256;ort we were able
  to extract the common  denominator in the form of core assets from existing appli-  cations
  speci&#64257;c to a medical &#64257;eld. For customisations well  de&#64257;ned
  variation points were developed. Our solution allows  for easy implementation of
  medical documentation require-  ments compared to tedious development of new applications  from
  scratch. It signi&#64257;cantly reduced the necessary devel-  opment e&#64256;ort
  and time to market. The resulting core doc-  umentation platform can be used for
  an arbitrary medical  &#64257;eld completely eliminating the dependence on the speci&#64257;c  customer
  domain.
