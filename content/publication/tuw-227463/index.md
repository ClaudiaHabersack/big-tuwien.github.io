abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems encompass the administration
  of all information about resources that are needed for companies to run their business.
  They support several functional areas, like accounting, manufacturing, and sales
  in form of modules that are integrated by a single database where all business relevant
  information is stored. In order to guarantee a flawless and productive use of the
  system, the economic phenomena underlying the business of the company have to be
  reflected in the user interface as well as the data structure itself. Usually ERP
  systems are purchased by customers from vendors in form of standard software. Such
  a software supports a predefined set of functionality and has to be further customized
  to the specific needs of an enterprise, which is not a trivial task and often leads
  to additional costs. Furthermore standard software only supports specific processes
  that are based on best-practice assumptions of the vendors. Therefore adjusting
  ERP systems to changed market demands is hard since they are missing a business
  semantic base. Changed business needs can often only be represented by drastic changes
  in the data structure or the code which can lead to inconsistencies.  The REAlist
  project uses a model-driven approach to overcome the aforementioned problems with
  existing ERP systems and enhance their adaptability. Business needs can be represented
  in an easy and unambiguous way as business models. These models define the features
  and look of the ERP system. REAlist uses the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology
  as a business modeling language since it was initially proposed to support the implementation
  of IT-Systems and is related to data modeling. REA allows the specification of events
  that have happened or are happening in the near future, resources affected by the
  events, and agents participating in the events. Furthermore, policies and commitments
  can be defined which are both important concepts of ERP systems. The underlying
  database of the REAlist project (REA DB) is based on REA and holds the business
  models as well as the business data. Its main part is generic, meaning that changed
  business needs can be applied to the ERP system without changing the data structure.
  Instead of using the classic class-diagram-like representation of REA, a domain
  specific language (REA-DSL) is used to simplify the creation of REA business models.  The
  aim of this thesis is to undertake the first steps of the REAlist project and create
  a mapping from REA-DSL business models to the REA DB. Furthermore user interfaces
  are automatically generated based on the saved models during runtime to reduce the
  effort that is needed for the customization tasks in existing ERP systems.
