abstract: The paper at hand focuses on the implementation of electronic government,
  in short eGovernment, in a big city that aimed at supporting the change of its administration
  into a customer-oriented "public service enterprise". Between 2001 and 2003 the
  City of Vienna realised 68 individual projects from nearly all areas of responsibility
  of the city administration in the framework of an eGovernment umbrella project.
  Vienna was one of the first city administrations to engage in such an overall project,
  yet given the size and variety of its administrative tasks there were hardly any
  comparable experiences to learn from or fall back to. This umbrella project can
  therefore be considered a pioneer project in the area of eGovernment and is presented
  here for the first time in a comprehensive overview. In particular, the project
  demonstrates the great importance of coordinated interaction and engagement of the
  political level, administration and IT policy for success-oriented eGovernment and
  the way this alliance was put into reality. As a practical objective the paper outlines
  the critical success factors and positive framework conditions for an eGovernment
  project based on the results of the umbrella project and closes with recommendations
  for the realisation of such a project. A relaunch of a big eGovernment programme
  in Vienna will be done in the frame-work of the outlined critical success factors.
