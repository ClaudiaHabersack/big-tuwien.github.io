abstract: The ceiling represents an unexplored domain that will soon be available
  as information space due to advances in technology. We investigated different interaction
  techniques for ceiling interaction. For this we developed a peripheral weather display
  projected onto the ceiling and a wizard of oz prototype. The applied interaction
  modes were laser pointing, finger pointing, and ball interaction. Overall, laser
  pointing was clearly favored by all participants, although ball interaction was
  rated highest concerning playfulness and fun of the interaction tasks. We also present
  initial design principles and parameters for the design of ceiling applications.
