abstract: The paper deals with the decision process for IT outsourcing as an governance
  strategy in case of IT harmonization. IT harmonization in this respect is the standardization
  of IT solutions and IT functionality within former autonomously acting organizational
  units with independently grown IT departments. A case study shows the migration
  and implementation of a lead e-government application in the Austrian federal administration,
  where records management and workflows previously have been operated independently
  in the government agencies. Harmonization has been accomplished via a directed outsourcing
  decision which also supported the process of harmonizing IT governance. Sourcing
  design has proven to be crucial in that case, as several stakeholders presented
  different principle objectives. The approach of the outsourcing decision within
  the case study is analyzed by examination of the decision process and interviewing
  key persons of the project.
