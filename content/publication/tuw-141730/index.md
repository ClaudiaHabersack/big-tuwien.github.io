abstract: The United Nation´s Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business
  (UN/CEFACT) is a standardization<br> body known for its work on UN/EDIFACT and ebXML.
  One of its most recent developments is<br> UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology (UMM).
  The UMM standard is used to model inter-organizational<br> business processes in
  the B2B domain. With the increasing availability of electronic governmental services<br>
  over networks, the frontier between B2B and B2G/G2G disappears. Today one expects
  a governmental<br> institution to react like any other business partner. Therefore
  also governments now face the interoperability<br> and compatibility issues as regular
  businesses do. In order to allow two governmental institutions to<br> collaborate,
  a methodology uniquely depicting the inter-organizational process from a global
  perspective<br> is needed. In this paper we propose to use UN/CEFACT´s Modeling
  Methodology in the eGovernment<br> domain. UMM allows the definition of a global
  choreography which is then being used to derive local orchestrations<br> for each
  business partner. Such orchestrations can then be used by enterprise applications
  in a<br> service oriented context. As an example, a real-world scenario from the
  waste transport domain within the<br> European Union will be shown. Furthermore
  the possible integration in the context of the We-Go project<br> [3] is examined.
