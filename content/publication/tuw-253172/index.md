abstract: The advances of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and their editors,
  created with modern language workbenches, have convinced domain experts of applying
  them as important and powerful means in their daily endeavors. Despite the fact
  that such editors are proficient in retaining syntactical model correctness, they
  present major shortages in mastering the preservation of consistency in models with
  elaborated language-specific constraints. Consequently, there is a demand for automating
  procedures to support editor users in both comprehending as well as resolving consistency
  violations. In this paper, we present an approach to automate the generation of
  advanced editing support for DSMLs offering automated validation, content-assist
  and quick fix capabilities beyond those created by state-of-the-art language workbenches
  that help domain experts in retaining and achieving the consistency of models. For
  validation, we show potential error causes for violated constraints, instead of
  only the context in which constraints are violated. The state-space explosion problem
  is mitigated by our approach resolving constraint violations by increasing the neighborhood
  scope in a three-stage process, seeking constraint repair solutions presented as
  quick fixes to the editor user. We illustrate and provide an initial evaluation
  of our approach based on an Xtext-based DSML for modeling service clusters.
