abstract: Current trends in manufacturing lead to more intelligent<br> products, produced
  in global supply chains in shorter cycles,<br> taking more and complex requirements
  into account. To manage<br> this increasing complexity, cognitive decision support
  systems,<br> building on data analytic approaches and focusing on the product<br>
  life cycle, stages seem a promising approach. With two high-tech<br> companies (world
  market leader in their domains) from Austria,<br> we are approaching this challenge
  and jointly develop cognitive<br> decision support systems for three real world
  industrial use cases.<br> Within this position paper, we introduce our understanding
  of<br> cognitive decision support and we introduce three industrial use<br> cases,
  focusing on the requirements for cognitive decision support.<br> Finally, we describe
  our preliminary solution approach for each<br> use case and our next steps
