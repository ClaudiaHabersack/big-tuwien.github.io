abstract: E-marketplaces on the World Wide Web are information and transaction silos,
  which in the general case don't allow transactions across their boundaries. The
  consequence is that the Web, often termed the global marketplace, is fragmented
  along the dimensions of geography, content domain, supply or demand, user base,
  and many more. This fragmentation makes it inefficient to buy and sell commodities
  on the Web. We propose a framework that serves as a foundation for a distributed,
  de-centralized e-marketplace on top of the Web, making boundaries between existing
  systems disappear from the user's perspective. The framework standardizes the creation
  and description of objects that represent supply and demand. In addition to this,
  it allows for independent matching services to connect objects suitable for a transaction
  and it defines protocols for the message exchange between such objects.
