abstract: In the development process of a B2B system it is crucial that the business
  experts are able to express and evaluate agreements and commitments between the
  partners and that the software engineers get all necessary information to bind the
  private process interfaces to the public ones. UN/CEFACT's modeling methodology
  (UMM) is a UML profile for developing B2B processes. The formalisms introduced by
  UMM's stereotypes facilitate the communication with the software engineers. However,
  business experts - who usually have a very limited understanding of UML - prefer
  expressing their thoughts and evaluating the results by plain text descriptions.
  In this paper we describe an approach that presents an equivalent of the UMM stereotypes
  and tagged values in text-based templates called worksheets. This strong alignment
  allows an integration into a UMM modeling tool and ensures consistency. We show
  how a specially designed XML-based worksheet definition language allows customization
  to special needs of certain business domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate how information
  kept in worksheets may be used for the semi-automatic generation of pattern-based
  UMM artifacts.
