abstract: 'When it comes to waste management and waste tracking, the main objectives
  are: prevent and reuse as much waste as possible. In the last decade, there has
  been a strong shift from the disposal of waste to recycling thereof. Within the
  EU, EU member states are required to establish waste prevention programs through
  the "Waste Framework EU Directive" which attempts to turn the EU into a recycling
  society. Similar endeavors also exist in other countries and regions. With globalization,
  the disposal of waste became a lucrative business case, often without transparency
  whether the waste has been disposed of properly and according to regulations or
  directives installed by each country. Waste flow management is the basis of sustainable
  waste prevention and recycling. Short-term solutions and financial profit accelerated
  malpractice in waste disposal and recycling. The currently used systems cannot track
  waste across borders in a transparent, but data-protected and tamper-proof way.
  Therefore, solutions to address these concerns have to be found and implemented.
  Blockchain enables new approaches, especially in ecosystems with distrust in every
  participating stakeholder, which is the case in waste flow tracking. We introduce
  and discuss a novel solution for waste tracking, on the basis of blockchain technology
  and smart contracts, that fulfills the aforementioned requirements.'
