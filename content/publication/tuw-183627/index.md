abstract: The paper discusses foundations and requirements for testing security robustness
  aspects in operational environments while adhering to de&#64257;ned protection values
  for data. It de&#64257;nes the problem space and special characteristics of security
  testing in large IT infrastructures. In this area there are different environments
  with varying characteristics, e.g., regarding con&#64257;dentiality of data. Common
  environments based on an existing IT project are de&#64257;ned. Testing in dedicated  test
  environments is state of the art, however, sometimes this is not suf&#64257;cient
  and testing in operational environments is required. Case studies showed many restrictions
  in the security test process, e.g., limited access for testers, which have to be
  addressed. The problems of testing in these operational environments are pointed
  out. Experiences and some current solution approaches for testing these special
  environments are shown (e.g., usage of disaster/recovery mechanism).
