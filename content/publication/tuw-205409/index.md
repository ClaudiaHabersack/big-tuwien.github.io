abstract: Security testing is an important and at the same time also expensive task
  for developing robust and secure systems. Test automation can reduce costs of security
  tests and increase test coverage and, therefore, increase the number of detected
  security issues during development. A common data format as the basis for specific
  test cases ensures that the implementation of the generation logic for security
  test data is only needed once and can be used for various data formats by transforming
  the data to the common data format, generating the test data and transforming back
  to the original data format. The introduced approach enables to generate test data
  for various formats using a single implementation of the generation algorithm and
  applying the results for specific test cases in different data formats.
