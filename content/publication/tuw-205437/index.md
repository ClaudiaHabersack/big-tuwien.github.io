abstract: 'In computer science education, one of the main goals  for educators is
  to prepare the student for employment in an  industrial environment. For this it
  is required that the students  are familiar with the major development process,
  ideally on the  example of a concrete student project. During a one-semester  software
  development seminar the students were grouped into 7  groups with 4-5 students each
  and each group was assigned  eXtreme Programming, SCRUM or Open Unified Process
  as  development process. Each student was asked to keep a  development diary and
  answer questionnaires during and at the  end of the project. Each group was asked
  to document the  changes to their development process, identified development  problems,
  employed mitigation strategies and the project  progress in form of a retrospective
  report. Analysis of the reports  revealed common issues and mitigation strategies,
  which can be  classified into the following: meeting organization;  communication;
  project roles, requirements engineering,  continuous tests and process adherence.
  The employed mitigation  strategies were classified into the same categories; quantified
  and  evaluated regarding their respective effectiveness.'
