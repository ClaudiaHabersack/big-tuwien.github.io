abstract: Integrating Semantic Web concepts into the domain of e-business is a hot<br>
  topic. However, most of the efforts spent so far concentrated on the<br> improvement
  on B2C (business-to-consumer) e-commerce applications,<br> achieved by semantic
  enrichment of information. With the growing<br> importance of Service Oriented Architectures
  (SOA) companies started to<br> move into the section of the Electronic Data Interchange
  (EDI), where<br> applications exchange their business information semi-automatically.<br>
  This B2B (business-to-business) electronic commerce is driven by<br> aligning the
  internal business processes of companies to publicly<br> available business processes.
  Thereby companies often do not consider<br> the economic drivers of their business
  processes, which leads to<br> incompatibilities between management, administration
  and technical<br> layers. This chapter covers the two major domains of e-business
  /<br> e-commerce, namely B2B and B2C. In the first, a model-driven<br> approach
  towards B2B IT solutions is introduced, covering semantic aspects dealing<br> with
  business models, business process models, and business document<br> models. In the
  second application domain, the basic concepts<br> of Semantic Web in the area of
  B2C electronic commerce are examined using a representative example from the e-tourism
  domain.
