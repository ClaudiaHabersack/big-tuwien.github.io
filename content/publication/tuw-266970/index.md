abstract: Electronic marketplaces are built to resemble real marketplaces structurally.
  Consequently, they are centralized systems, walled gardens with an intrinsic tendency
  to lock merchants and clients in. We argue that this structure is not necessary
  on the Web and that all online marketplaces could merge into one global medium for
  exchange. In this paper, we propose an architecture for such a medium based on semantic
  Web standards, encompassing the functionalities of publishing an intention to buy
  or sell, finding transaction partners, and conducting transactions. We focus on
  the basic protocol layer and explain how messaging and linked data are combined
  in a novel way to realize a highly dynamic communication system.
