abstract: Research that focuses on designing mobile technology for individuals who
  engage in self-injury or suffer from borderline personality disorder together with
  patients is scarce. In a previous study, a concept for a mobile app that aims to
  support above mentioned target population was established. Requirements were derived
  from talking to psychotherapists and psychiatrists. Based on this preliminary work
  a new project seeks to include the end user perspective and establish a holistic
  concept for such an app featuring patients´ opinions by applying an iterative user
  centred design approach. The authors will interview 20 patients in order to explore
  their thoughts and opinions, thus derive requirements from interview data, which
  will then be implemented in a prototype of the system. This project contributes
  opinions and wishes from a `hard-to-reach´ population. Looking into their beliefs
  adds to understanding what self-harm recovery entails for patients and what mobile
  technology, if tailored to the expectations of the end users themselves, can do
  to support the therapy process. Currently, the authors are recruiting patients and
  aim to establish ethics approval to work with patients at a regional medical institution.
  The preliminary work together with therapists is also very important and needs to
  be combined with the wishes of the target group to get an app, which can cover the
  whole process for the patients. The authors would like to give an oral presentation
  at the ECRF17 to talk about the concrete ideas for gathering requirements and combining
  them with already identified ones from the therapists.
