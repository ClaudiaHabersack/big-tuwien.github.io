abstract: Recent developments show a huge increase in the usage of touchscreen devices
  like smartphones, tablets and public-terminals. Established touchscreen-applications
  rely on using the coordinate feature of the recognized finger contact area. In addition,
  finger input properties like the size and orientation of the finger contact area,
  the proximity to the touchscreen surface and the pressure applied to the surface
  can also be measured by most of the common technologies. The scope of this thesis
  was to identify which of these properties are useful add-ons for the touch gesture
  dictionary. Based on the size of the finger contact area a new gesture, entitled
  Rock Zoom, was developed and used in a prototype application. By using the Rock
  Zoom gesture the size of a displayed picture can be modified by changing the size
  of the finger contact area. The latter depends on the angle between finger and touchscreen
  surface. A user test including nine participants was conducted to compare Rock Zoom
  with the established Pinch Zoom gesture. Therefore, both gestures were implemented
  in discrete and continuous versions. The continuous version allows arbitrary change
  of the picture size. In contrast, the discrete version restricts the available sizes.
  Findings show similar values of the task completion time between the Rock Zoom method
  restricted to five zoom-levels and the Pinch Zoom gestures. Missed task targets
  analysis shows, that there was no occurrence of an unintentional change of the picture
  size when applying the discrete Rock Zoom gesture.
