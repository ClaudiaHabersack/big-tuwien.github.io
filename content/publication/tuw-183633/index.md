abstract: In this paper we present the concept of Audio-tactile Location Markers (ALMs)
  as a remedy to the lack of accessibility in current tag-based applications. ALMs
  are an auxiliary enhancement for existing real-world tags, which propagates their
  existence and purpose to blind and vision impaired people in the vicinity. Users
  can activate an audible signal based on a pre-selection of available tags (pull)
  or choose to be constantly informed about nearby tags (push). We evaluated both
  methods with blind and vision-impaired people using an NFC-enabled smartphone. Participants
  experienced no problems locating the ALM based on the audible signal, but required
  assistance with touching the tag. Pull was favored to push in specific situations.
