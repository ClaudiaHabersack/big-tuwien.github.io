### Topic

The Austrian e-billing standard ebInterface has been supported by major Austrian ERP-vendors. Thus, the XML-based ebInterface standard may be used in Austria to exchange invoices by electronic means. However, the critical mass of adopters has not yet been reached, which limits the full potential of electronic e-billing in Austria. In order to become more attrective to potential adopters the ebInterface standard have to be revisited according to the following issues: \* Update of the standard to incorporate requirements reported from the ERP-vendors, early adopters and potential adopters. \* Evaluation of a concept for plug-ins into the standard that allow industry-specific extensions to the standards \* Simplification of those parts of the standard that cause misinterpretation and hinder adoption of the standard
