### Topic

The main goal of DARWIN is to provide an extensible framework based on well-established conceptual modeling languages and model-driven engineering techniques enabling developers to entirely develop and evolve SIs at an appropriate level of abstraction. To accomplish this goal, a prototype will be developed. Case studies will be conducted in cooperation with “JoinVision”, as well as “Team Communication Technology Management Gmbh (Team)” a company currently conducting a FIT-IT Semantic Systems project to leverage ontology-driven situation awareness in large-scale control systems. Together with these demonstrators and external experts from academia, namely Jordi Cabot (École des Mines de Nantes), Dragan Gaševic (Athabasca University), and Steffen Staab (University of Koblenz-Landau) and from industry (“Franz Inc.”, supplier of commercial, scalable RDF Graph Database products) we intend to evaluate the applicability of our prototype for developing and maintaining the Semantic Infrastructures of Semantic Web applications as well as traditional applications. Along this overall research focus, DARWIN pursues three key research goals: Model-driven Semantic Infrastructure Development, Change-Aware Development Environment, Semi-Automatd Co-Evolution.
