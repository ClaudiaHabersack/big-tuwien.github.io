abstract: 'Urban environments have evolved to rich digital information spaces over
  the last few  years: they are virtually enriched with a steadily increasing amount
  of georeferenced  content and instrumented with gadgets such as local transmitters
  and ambient displays  providing passers-by with additional information. At the same
  time, advances in mo-  bile computing technology led to powerful mobile devices
  such as smartphones able  to act as mediators to surrounding digital content. However,
  current solutions for ex-  ploring urban environments with the help of a mobile
  device still stick to traditional  approaches such as map representations.  This
  thesis is concerned with the investigation of advanced mobile user interfaces  for
  a more e&#64259;cient, seamless, and intuitive exploration of urban environments.
  Its  main contribution is a series of novel techniques and appropriate fully functional
  pro-  totypes. The described technical realizations based on a custom auxiliary
  service  platform and respective functional trials help to gain insights into the
  possibilities and  challenges of such upcoming interface approaches.  Inspired by
  recent computing trends in industry and academia, the thesis presents  three novel
  mobile interaction prototypes. The proposed techniques range from a mo-  bile "attentive
  user interface" exploiting a human´s eye-gaze for discovering objects-  of-interest
  over a fully mobile solution for the detection of free-hand gestures to the  sophisticated
  vision-based interaction with embedded ambient displays.  Complementing these interaction
  concepts, the thesis introduces and investigates  novel visualization techniques
  for spatial information. Questioning the traditional  top-down map view for information-rich
  urban environments, three alternatives are  proposed: an egocentric approach and
  a bird´s eye perspective utilizing a 3D building  model rendered in real-time as
  well as an abstract information visualization which  emphasizes the contentual aspect
  of georeferenced information over its spatial com-  ponent.  To empirically validate
  the novel visualization concepts a comprehensive user  study was conducted. The
  presented evaluation focused on increasingly relevant as-  pects such as overviewing
  and &#64257;ltering spatial information and demonstrates the ben-  e&#64257;t of
  alternative mobile views and hybrid visualizations.'
