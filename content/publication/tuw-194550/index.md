abstract: SPICS (Secure Platform for Integrating Clinical Services) is an e-health
  research project at the Vienna University of Technology. The application allows
  different health care providers to share a common database of patients' data for
  global surveys (e.g. progress of wound healing, effects of medications, etc.). Doctors,
  hospitals, and other specialist working groups can share their anonymized data and
  perform large-scale and long-term scientific analysis. The platform is implemented
  as a software product line to fulfill a number of critical requirements and special
  needs of the medical sector. After an initial pilot phase, the SPICS product portfolio
  started to grow and the platform has been enriched with more functionality. As the
  user group grew steadily, the decision was made to improve the quality assurance
  process in SPICS. The goal was to increase the quality of the products and minimize
  the test efforts by implementing a test management and requirements engineering
  structure that supported the variability concept of the product line. This thesis
  will describe the implementation of this process by means of a case study
