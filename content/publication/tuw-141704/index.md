abstract: This thesis analyses the issue of how to extend the electronic delivery,
  which is already in use, for secured transmission of documents from the administration
  to citizens. The focus of the current thesis is to find a solution to enable secure
  communication between natural and/or legal persons. After explaining the initial
  situation and clarifying the legal and technical basics, the existing system of
  the official electronic delivery is described in detail. The conclusion of this
  analysis is that the official electronic delivery system offers, due its open system
  architecture, potentials which can be used in the external environment. Furthermore,
  the requirements for the electronic delivery in the external environment were analysed
  and necessary extensions revealed. Based on these investigations and, moreover,
  on the case study "kommerzielle e-Zustellung" ("commercial e-delivery") by the Austrian
  chamber of commerce (WKO), a concept of an electronic delivery system for an external
  environment is presented. The main problem of this concept is that the prospective
  system must be available for many potential users and should also offer legal and
  technical security. The solution for these problems is to build the system in a
  modular way, in the form of a service-oriented architecture, which can be adapted
  to the respective needs of different users if necessary. For a better understanding
  of the electronic delivery system in the external environment, the process flow
  from the view of the sender, the receiver and the system components is modelled.
  As a conclusion of the thesis possible business case are introduced.
