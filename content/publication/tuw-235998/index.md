abstract: Near Field Communication (NFC) is an radio frequency (RF) based proximity
  coupling technology allowing transactions within a range up to 10 cm. With NFC,
  a key technology is on its way into the consumer´s most personal device, allowing
  the customer to use his devices for secure services such as payment or ticketing
  but also for service initiation or data exchange. Interoperability is one of the
  most important goals to be achieved prior to roll out devices and services, in order
  to satisfy the consumer´s expectations. This chapter deals with different operating
  modes and use cases that can be im- plemented with NFC technology with ghe main
  focus on mobile phones. This high level description is backed up with a look into
  the hardware architecture for NFC as well as the software stack in mobile phones.
  The chapter ends with a description of tags and tag-formats for the NFC ecosystem.
