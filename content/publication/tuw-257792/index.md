abstract: Software testing is an important software-engineering discipline and a major
  quality assurance task, which requires sufficient resources. Nowadays mobile native
  applications are mostly developed in separate teams, because of the heterogeneity
  of the dominant platforms, which leads to redundancies in several test related activities.
  Platform independent testing tools and single-sourcing of test cases can be used
  to reduce unnecessary or duplicated workloads. These superfluities of functional
  tests can be reduced by the usage of platform independent testing frameworks. In
  general the exploitation of higher test levels, like acceptance tests, and a strong
  focus on the graphical user interface make these savings possible. Existing literature
  is not able to give advice whether these tools provide equal abilities in case of
  fundamental functionalities and common software characteristics, especially readability
  and maintainability of test cases. Thus two qualified open-source frameworks, Calabash
  and Appium, are analysed in detail. In further consequence a prototypic implementation
  of well selected test cases in the context of an example application is provided
  and the results are evaluated. For comparison purposes, the same set of test cases
  is also realised with platform specific frameworks. The results suggest the usage
  of platform independent solutions as they exhibit similar properties in case of
  element identification, element interaction and diverse software characteristics
  in comparison to their platform specific alternatives and reduce redundancies at
  the same time.
