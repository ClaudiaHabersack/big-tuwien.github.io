abstract: Context  Developing software in distributed development environments exhibits
  coordination, control and communication challenges. Agile practices, which demand
  frequent communication and self-organization between remote sites, are increasingly
  found in global software development (GSD) to mitigate said challenges.  Objective  We
  aim to provide detailed insight into what is reported on the successful application
  of agile practices in GSD from 1999 to 2016 and also identify the most frequently
  applied agile practices and reported distribution scenarios. We further strive to
  uncover research opportunities and gaps in the field of agile GSD.  Method  We build
  our systematic literature review on top of a previous review, which investigated
  studies published between 1999 and 2009, and extend the review by years 2010-2016,
  for which we conduct both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis.  Results  Our
  results show that the majority of the cases studied is global and involves complex
  distribution scenarios with Scrum or combined Scrum/Extreme Programming being the
  most used agile methods. Key results include that in contrast to 1999-2009, where
  four Extreme Programming practices were among the ten most frequently used agile
  practices, in 2010-2016 Scrum is in the center of agile GSD implementations with
  eight Scrum-based practices in the top ten agile practices used in GSD.  Conclusion  Agile
  GSD is a maturing research field with higher quality contributions and a greater
  variety of publication types and methods from 2010 to 2016 than before from 1999
  to 2009. However, researchers need to report full empirical contextual details of
  their studied cases in order to improve the generalizability of results and allow
  the future creation of stronger frameworks to drive the implementation of agile
  practices in GSD.
