abstract: Standardized business documents are a prerequisite for successful information
  exchange in electronic business transactions. The United Nations Centre for Trade
  Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) provides a conceptual modeling approach,
  called Core Components, used by Business Partners (BPs) for defining business document
  models (BDMs). These BDMs are essential for defining service interfaces in service-oriented
  systems. However, in such a highly dynamic environment with ever-changing market
  demands, BPs are confronted with the need to revise their BDMs resulting in new
  versions of BDMs. Furthermore, BPs may dictate the use of new versions of BDMs.
  However, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may not always adopt new BDM
  versions due to the cost and effort involved, inhibiting electronic information
  exchange. In this paper, we present a framework for dealing with interoperability
  issues in service-oriented systems through providing BPs with Business Document
  Interoperability as a Service. Having such a framework at hand provides SMEs with
  a low-cost and light-weight approach for dealing with evolving market requirements
  and hence evolving business documents. Furthermore, we present a prototypical implementation
  as well as an evaluation of the framework proposed.
