abstract: 'In the today´s world of networked computing processes the reliable user
  identification and authentication has become an inevitable part of any system´s
  security. This is especially the case with security sensitive web-applications,
  like on-line banking platforms, on-line e-mail accounts, on-line gambling applications,
  or briefly worded: everywhere where privacy is a must. From a security professional´s
  point of view most of them are poorly protected by a simple username/ password authentication
  scheme; this is barely sufficient anymore. In the course of this diploma thesis
  the goal was to develop a general purpose authentication system for browser-based
  applications, which satisfies the today´s security requirements, but without being
  harder to deploy, and use, nor more expensive than the aging paradigms. The only
  way to achieve these goal settings, is to reuse some pre-existing technology; consequently
  the authentication framework was built upon components evolved from the Austrian´s
  national ID smart-card project (Austrian citizen card), in particular the e-card.
  These devices are already distributed all over the Austrian citizens, in fact all
  the required hardware already is available. In this way, a strong authentication
  scheme was created, which is based upon hardware authenticators, digital certificates,
  and a PKI in the background, without occasioning additional costs. This can be used
  by everyone, from companies to individuals all over the Republic of Austria, in
  the most versatile scenarios.'
