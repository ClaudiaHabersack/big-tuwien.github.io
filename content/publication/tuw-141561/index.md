abstract: 'Phishing takes advantage of both technical and human weak points in order
  to mislead the victim as to the reliability of the received email message or contents
  of a web page. A Phishing attack consists typically of two components: a respectable
  looking email and a fraudulent web page, which both imitate the corporate design
  of the alleged enterprise. If the victim divulges his personal user data, the aggressor
  can abuse this identity to financially benefit himself. The principal purpose of
  the empirical part of this work is the collection of characteristics with which
  users, dependent on their experience in the Internet, examine a web page for it´s
  authenticity. For this purpose an experiment with 26 participants, seven legal web
  pages and 13 self-provided Phishing sites, was conducted.  Both the less experienced
  users and the experienced users, on average, used the same number of identified
  criteria in order to investigate the authenticity of a site. The two groups differed,
  however, in the specific criteria used. Less experienced users paid attention primarily
  to contents of a web page and did not consider browser specific security indicators.
  Both the address bar and the status bar of a browser played no or only a small role
  with this group of users in its identification judgement of the authenticity of
  a site. With the experienced users, however, the indicated information of a browser,
  for example the domain name in the address bar and the safety symbol in the status
  bar, played a relevant role in its evaluation. Attempted frauds with the domain
  name and the safety symbol were rarely noticed, however, by both groups of participants.
  This brings the conclusion that anti-phishing solutions should not only refer peripherally
  and passively to a fraud, but also actively intervene in the user action. The input
  of user data on the site should be prevented and one, also for a layman, easily
  understandable explanation be presented. Further, it is not sufficient to refer
  the user to a potential fraud, but possible steps and solutions must additionally
  be pointed out.'
