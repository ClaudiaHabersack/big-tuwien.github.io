abstract: Due to the continuously increasing networking of computer technology, the
  threat of attacks against individual computer systems and the software that they
  run is growing likewise. In numerous cases, software faults are responsible for
  security vulnerabilities which are being exploited by hackers. Therefore, security
  is becoming more and more important in software engineering. In order to evaluate
  a program's security, security tests are used by the software industry. The overall
  goal of security testing is to _nd and eliminate vulnerabilities within a software
  system. A particular technique for such security tests is so-called "fuzzing", in
  which invalid, unexpected, or random data is used as input for the software being
  tested. In order to recognize anomalies and errors that are caused by the fuzzer,the
  target object is monitored. This thesis deals with the monitoring of Java applications
  for the purpose of discovering security problems. It describes a proof-of-concept
  implementation based on the Java virtual machine. In order to accomplish this, data
  access on a test object is investigated and logged. The results can then be used
  for automatic detection of security vulnerabilities.
