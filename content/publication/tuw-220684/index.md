abstract: One and the same inter-organizational business process - such as e-procurement
  - may be executed differently in different industries, geopolitical regions, etc.
  Thus, a standardized reference model for inter-organizational business process must
  be customized to the specific business context (industry, region, etc.). In order
  to share, search, and (partially) re-use context specific adaptations it is essential
  not only to store the adaptations, but also a business context model where these
  adaptations are valid. Therefore, we present our ontology based business context
  model and explain how it can be applied to generic models of semantically interoperable
  data blocks, so-called Core Components. Core Components are standardized by the
  United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT),
  and their adaptations are exchanged between business partners in the course of inter-organizational
  business processes. If we could assign a business context to a business process,
  we could prevent negative trends in today's business, such as interoperability issues,
  inconsistencies and heterogeneous interpretations of the interchanged electronic
  business documents.
