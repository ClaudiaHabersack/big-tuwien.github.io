abstract: Business document standards usually cover a hierarchical structure of thousands
  of elements that may be relevant in any business context (any geopolitical region,
  any industry, etc.). In order to use a business document standard in a specific
  context, user groups define so-called business document implementation guidelines
  based on a smaller subset consisting usually of 3-5% of the overall elements. When
  one defines a new implementation guideline for a specific business context, one
  has always to start from scratch, which is time-consuming and also leads to heterogeneous
  interpretations of the standard. It is our goal to speed up the development process
  and to create more homogeneous implementation guidelines by learning from existing
  models. If we could assign a formal context to existing implementation guidelines,
  we may predict the subset of a new implementation guideline for a given context.   We
  especially consider implementation guidelines built on the top of the Core Components
  Technical Specification (CCTS). These guidelines consist of business context specific
  data building blocks which are restricted from more general, semantically interoperable
  Core Components. In order to share, search, and (partially) re-use context specific
  restrictions of Core Components it is essential not only to store the restrictions,
  but also a business context model where these restrictions are valid. Therefore,
  we develop the Enhanced UN/CEFACT Business Context Model (E-UCM) and the Business
  Context Ontology Model (BCOnt) for representing business context in the domain of
  Core Components.   This thesis proposes an approach to contextualize already existing
  Core Components by means of our business context models. This contextual information
  is also used to predict a subset for to-be developed electronic business document
  implementation guidelines based on existing ones. The underlying algorithms calculate
  degrees of business context match, detect different types of mappings between existing
  Core Components and generate Core Component based contents of new implementation
  guidelines.  Our research has been conducted following the design science research
  process. The corresponding evaluation is interpreted as a build and evaluate loop
  iterated a number of times before the final approach was developed. We evaluate
  the business context models on the basis of 16 evaluation criteria. The feasibility
  of the business context aware Core Components modeling approach is demonstrated
  by a prototype implementation. The analysis of the calculated precision and recall
  rates proves that our approach holds not only in theory, but also in practice.
