abstract: The tighter coupling of enterprises in regard to information system technology
  has also changed the way business processes are modeled. Modeling interorganizational
  business processes is necessary in order to gain a profound and unique representation
  of the processes involved. However this requires a new methodology especially designed
  for modeling inter-organizational business processes. The United Nation´s Center
  for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) took up the challenge
  and started to develop such a methodology. The research efforts became known as
  UN/CEFACT´s modeling methodology (UMM) [1]. UMM enables the business modeler to
  capture the business knowledge independent of the underlying implementation technology
  such as ebXML or Web Services. Due to the popularity of the Unified Modeling Language
  (UML) the UMM is built on top of it. UMM is defined as a UML profile - i.e. a set
  of stereotypes, tagged values and constraints - in order to customize the UML meta
  model for the specific purpose of modeling the collaborative space in B2B. Although
  the standard is well developed and documented, its complexity and mightiness make
  it difficult for the novice user to perceive from scratch. Therefore a tool, supporting
  themodeler in creating a validUMMmodel would help those inexperienced with UMM.We
  have developed such a plug-in for the UML modeling tool Enterprise Architect 1 called
  UMM Add-In 2.We highlight the main features of the Add-In and show how the tool
  facilitates the use of the methodology.
