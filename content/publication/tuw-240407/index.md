abstract: 'Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are often cumbersome to customize
  to a clientÂ´s needs. Model-driven approaches promise to simplify these attempts.
  In this work we present an ERP prototype based on the Resource-Event-Agent (REA)
  business ontology that follows a "model-at-runtime" approach: one may customize
  the ERP system during runtime by changing the underlying REA models. We are using
  Retail-H as the reference framework for building a retail information system (RIS).
  Our main contribution is the prototypical implementation of a domain agnostic REA
  engine that can be loaded at runtime with domain specific business models-these
  models can further be manipulated at runtime. On that basis we have exemplarily
  modeled main concepts of Retail-H in REA. Validation of the implemented components
  is realized by applying real business activities and requirements received from
  our partner, a business software solution provider.'
