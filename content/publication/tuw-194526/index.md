abstract: 'Knowledge is one of the most important resources in modern society, as
  well as for organizations and individuals. This importance is represented by the
  terms "information society" and the newer "knowledge society." A new development
  parallel to this know-ledge society is emerging, in which connectivity is an equally
  important source for competitive advantage. Networks and communities are the main
  themes of this new development, which is known as the "network society." In this
  model of modern society, organizations are confronted with the need to agilely develop
  new competences in order to react to dynamically changing market needs. However,
  these competences cannot evolve autonomously: they must be developed through interaction
  with relevant market participants. In order to achieve the speed necessary to react
  in sync with market shifts, it is necessary to build up new connections and kinds
  of virtual organizations aligned with market requirements. Information must be smoothly
  exchanged between these organizations and their environments in order for organizations
  to build up the required knowledge. From a technical point of view, the Digital
  Business Ecosystem (DBE) provides an infrastructure in which connections between
  organizations can be efficiently established. In order to implement such a system
  in the given region Centrope, an extensive exchange and creation of knowledge must
  take place. This thesis describes, based on a general introduction to the field
  of knowledge management, the requirements for the kind of virtual organization necessary
  to implement a DBE project and methods for fostering the transfer and creation of
  knowledge.'
