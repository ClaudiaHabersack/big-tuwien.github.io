abstract: The field of financial markets is complex and challenging due to the rapid
  growth of communication technologies and financial markets. Thus, new services and
  technologies have to be adopted early whereas the architectural requirements for
  such portals increase continuously. This results in very high requirements for IT-infrastructure
  with regard to flexibility and reliance. The analysis of an implemented system may
  result in useful findings that can be transferred to several other research fields.
  Thus, this diploma thesis analyzes and generalizes the architecture of stock-market-information-portals.
  The basis for the analytical process are the realized solutions of an important
  Austrian provider. They are used to identify important quality attributes and to
  derive a general architectural model.   Stock-market-information-portals are highly
  specialized Web-portals. They aggregate information around the topic financial markets.
  The main purpose is to provide current market prices. Furthermore, they present
  financial news-reports as well as facts and figures of corporations. These portals
  offer a wide variety of information about the instruments of the worldwide financial
  markets. For this task it is necessary to distinguish between the fields of fundamental
  analysis and technical analysis.   The presented requirement analyses of the implemented
  systems provide the fundamental quality attributes these systems have to consider
  and to satisfy. Based on these attributes, a general hardware- and software-model
  was derived. In addition the most important special components have been identified
  and analyzed. The core of the hardware architecture is a distributed storage system
  for the market data. Further central parts are the usage of middleware and a special
  engine for the generation of charts. All these design decisions are based on the
  previously identified fundamental quality attributes. Finally, a general architecture
  model of the system is presented.
