abstract: Agile and lean software development practices have been developed in early
  2000 and continuously gained popularity every since. Concepts for multi-project
  management in the field, on the other hand, have only started to evolve very recently.
  Currently estab-lished agile and lean literature does not really focus on this issue.
  Publications tend to deal with very specific approaches such as e.g. organization-wide
  agile and lean trans-formations. This observation is the motivation for a further
  investigation and evaluation of agile and lean values in a multi-project management
  environment. The thesis begins with an analysis of known traditional process frameworks
  to draw conclusions for lean and agile practices. Then known lean-agile multi-project
  manage-ment approaches in literature and research are examined. Furthermore, a case
  study is conducted covering three projects in a distributed development environment.
  The lean-agile practice in use is then analyzed, evaluated and improved with regard
  to the theo-retic concepts. In conclusion, the adoption of lean-agile values in
  traditionally grown and run organizations is discussed in light of findings from
  the case study and the litera-ture review. Results show that almost all regular
  traditional multi-project management goals also have a lean-agile counterpart. However,
  the ways in which they are achieved are com-pletely different, e.g. regarding hierarchies
  and styles of management. The application in traditional organizations imposes several
  constraints, e.g. former project managers may not want to let go of established
  hierarchies and handicap the self-management of teams as fake Scrum Masters. The
  review of the lean-agile approaches revealed that the shared highest goal is to
  pro-vide transparency across the value stream, which is especially important in
  a multi-project environment. Moreover, simple communication is the preferred means
  to deal with impediments, in the Daily Scrum, Scrum of Scrums or an optional third-layer
  Meta Scrum. Apart from communication and interaction, transparency is achieved via
  incre-mental planning and prioritization in all the examined approaches. Finally,
  a best practice lean-agile multi-management approach is suggested combining several
  ideas.
