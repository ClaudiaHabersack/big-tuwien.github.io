abstract: 'This diploma thesis explores trends in collaborative computing on multi-touch
  tabletops. The thesis focuses on identifying problems, which appear in multi-user
  situations, and identifying possibilities to minimize their effects. In doing so,
  we follow the approach, that heuristics can be used to improve the usability while
  collaborating. In contrast, the related work mainly tries to enhance multi-user
  awareness with the help of additional hardware. Common problems of multi-user usage
  are for example caused by incorrect groupings and interpretation of gestures. These
  should be enhanced with heuristics concerning the characteristics of robustness,
  performance, correctness and stability. In doing so, a set of possibilities to avoid
  problems of multi-user usage via algorithms and design guidelines is identified:
  These are segmented on different levels - gesture specific, object specific, user
  specific and spatial. Within those levels, for every identified problem at least
  one improvement opportunity is shown. In comparison to operating with additional
  hardware, as it can be found in the related work, the heuristics are flexible in
  use - however, the identification of the users and additional interaction techniques
  are limited. With the help of an explorative, comparative evaluation of two prototypes
  developed in this thesis - one with, one without implemented improvements -, the
  heuristics were validated. To sum up, the study shows, that the users were more
  content with the improved version of the prototype and less problems occurred during
  the test.'
