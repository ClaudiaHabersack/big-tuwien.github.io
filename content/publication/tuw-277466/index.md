abstract: 'Several organizations are engaged in developing software product lines
  for specific mobile application domains. Initial test cases are often created at
  the product line level followed by specialized test cases for each product. With
  every new product variant that is added to the software product line the overall
  number of test cases and the complexity of the testing process increases. The biggest
  problem is that testing a software product line is often tedious since both common
  features as well as feature variations must be tested for each product of the line.
  Furthermore, if organizations seek to embrace new but similar business domains,
  they must design the test framework for the new software product line from scratch.
  These issues can delay the testing process and can lead to time delays, irrelevant
  test results, and/or higher costs. This thesis proposes a proof-of-concept implementation
  of a re-usable test framework for Android application software product lines. The
  thesis investigates answers to research questions such as: which characteristics
  does the test framework have to satisfy to support testing of software product lines
  efficiently? What benefits can be achieved by providing re-usable test cases? And
  which properties does the architecture of the test framework have to make available
  to enable its re-use for future software product lines? A reverse generalization
  strategy for the creation of test cases is introduced, which intends to create single
  test cases at such a generic and re-usable level that one test case can handle all
  product variants. Consequently, a single test case is enough to cover one use case
  scenario for all the products of a software product line. The framework provides
  a set of reusable test cases based on the analysis of common and varying features
  in a software product line chosen as a representative case study. By supporting
  the reusability of individual test steps and test cases the time-to-market and cost
  for new member products and features of the software product line can be reduced
  and the test process can be accelerated for all products. Additionally, the architectural
  design of the test framework provided supports maintainability, expandability and
  reusability for new mobile software product line projects. Finally, the test framework
  is evaluated using the scenario-based evaluation strategy. The evaluation of the
  test framework shows that newly added products to the software product line can
  be easily included in the test framework without any need for major modifications.
  Thereby, economic efficiency, reduced test effort and fast test coverage of new
  products is achieved.'
