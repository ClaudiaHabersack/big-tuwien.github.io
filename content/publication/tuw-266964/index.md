abstract: The level of digitalization within transport companies is much higher than
  the level of digitalization across organization boundaries. This fact suggests that
  there is room for improvement. However, this situation is not likely to change as
  long as there is no financial incentive for the whole sector to cooperate in establishing
  a shared communication infrastructure. In this paper, we present our approach for
  building such an infrastructure using the method of design science. The goal is
  an open, Web based, de-centralized network operated by transport organizations themselves.
  Based on expert interviews, we argue that the current situation causes frictions
  that our approach may help reduce, thereby providing the incentive to participate.
  The proposed system is described in terms of its existing technologicial base, the
  Web of Needs, and the extensions needed to provide the required functionality, giving
  an overview of the current state of implementation.
