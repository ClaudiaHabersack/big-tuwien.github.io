abstract: Information visualization (IV) is a key technology in the information age.
  Following the establishment of data-driven systems in all areas of modern live,
  IV techniques are increasingly common outside of a scientific context. Particularly
  artists and designers are applying the new techniques, making aesthetics an important
  factor in practice. Theoretical frameworks and an adequate taxonomy considering
  aesthetics are currently emerging. The most extensive approach is the concept of
  information aesthetics (IA) as compromise between traditional IV and visualization
  art (VA). To establish aesthetics as a valuable complement for traditional IV and
  to antagonize fears of a trivialization of the field, scientific results on positive
  effects of information aesthetic visualization techniques are required. To produce
  those results a comprehensive study design for a user evaluation is proposed in
  this thesis. The core of the study design form three visualization prototypes that
  are especially implemented according to the respective specifics of IV, IA, and
  VA. Thus, controlled conditions are created and comparable results can be obtained
  in the scope of the suggested study. A substantial part of this work is the extensive
  design process for these three prototypes, which is based on the analysis of related
  work and theoretical considerations. For the study methodology, insight generation
  and user engagement are chosen as central measures to capture the qualitatively
  different effects of aesthetic influences in the three domains. Especially the measurement
  of insight with the thinking-aloud method can capture analytic and emotional results
  alike. Creating an understanding of the cognitive effects of IV, beyond effective
  and efficient task solving, is necessary for the systematic and reasonable application
  of IV techniques in new settings. The result of this work, a set of three test applications
  with tailored evaluation methodology, forms an exemplary setup for measuring a broad
  range of qualitative cognitive user reaction in the IV domain with especial emphasis
  on aesthetics.
