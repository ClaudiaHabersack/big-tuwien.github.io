abstract: This report describes the challenges and experi- ences with the incremental
  re-engineering and migration of a 40 year old airport operations system. The undocumented
  COBOL legacy system has to be replaced within given con- straints such as limited
  downtime. A 3-step technical strategy is derived and successfully applied to the
  re-engineering task in this project. The incremental approach and resulting parallel
  operations of both systems are the most significant technical drivers for complexity
  in this environment. Furthermore, this report describes the process for planning,
  analyzing and designing a replacement system that is backed by strong user acceptance.
  The user interface design task of taking the system from VT100 to a web interface
  was a critical success factor, as well as live testing with actual production data
  and actual user interactions. Other aspects such as training and end user documentation
  are discussed.
