abstract: Online surveys are an important means of data collection in marketing and
  research, but conventional survey designs are often perceived as dull and unengaging,
  resulting in negative respondent behavior. Gamification has been proposed to make
  online surveys more pleasant to fill and, consequently, to improve the quality of
  survey results. This work applied gamification to an existing survey targeted at
  teenagers and young adults. The gamified survey was evaluated in a study with 60
  participants regarding the psychological and behavioral outcomes of gamification.
  Results indicate that gamification successfully increased the usersÂ´ perceived fun,
  the average time spent, as well as their willingness to use and recommend the survey,
  without introducing a strong bias in survey results, albeit with a lower overall
  response rate.
