abstract: Electric locks are often used instead of common locking mechanisms in hotels
  and office buildings. The advantages of these systems lie in their ability to centrally
  manage access authorization, possibility of reporting arrival and departure times,
  simple deactivation and reissuing of lost access authorizations when the hardware
  is lost as well as a reduction of needed hardware with the end user. More and more,
  such locking mechanisms are also used in residential buildings. Used in this context,
  there are fundamentally different priorities the user has regarding security and
  trust in the lock. While an electric locking mechanisms at office buildings places
  most, if not all of the risk in the employers responsibility, the same setup at
  home risks the users whole livelihood, or worse, his familiy. This thesis is meant
  to build a bridge between the topics usability, trust and by extension security.
  For that, theoretical groundwork is laid at first. A real world example of an electric
  locking mechanism and the corresponding administration software is presented and
  put under scrutiny by a usability test. For this, previously described usability
  testing methods are used. There will also be a survey with the intent of questioning
  a user-s trust in different locking mechanisms and comparing the corresponding results.
  This will also be undergone by using usability testing methods. The result of this
  thesis is an overview over the usability of a locking mechanisms administration
  software as well as a baseline depicting trust in three different locking mechanisms.
  There will be mentioned possibilities to measure trust and extend existing models
  to accommodate this new dimension. In a nutshell, this thesis presents an overview
  of usability and trust, briefly describes security and presents theoretical models.
  Then, two studies are done and their results analysed and presented.
