abstract: Despite all progress on the scientific foundations of  information system
  security, human factor attacks are still not  sufficiently researched. This is mostly
  due to the  multidimensional attack vector that spans organizational,  technical
  and human aspects. These multidimensional attack  vectors require equally multifaceted
  counter measures. This  paper evaluates security measures according to ITIL for
  their  potential to serve as such a multidimensional counter measure.  ITIL measures
  will be classified according to their application  area in preventing or counter
  acting attacks, thus providing a  management catalogue of security measures against
  social  engineering attacks.
