abstract: Air travel has become increasingly popular. In Austria, there were 4.3 million
  flights in 2014. At airports, typical problems for travelers include orientation
  and information retrieval regarding flights, available shops or offered services.
  Most often, this information is provided only by signposts and flight overview panels.
  This thesis presents ideas and approaches for a mobile application to optimize the
  time for travelers at airports. Smartphones and tablets, which are carried by most
  travelers today, would be ideal platforms to implement an information and orientation
  system for the everyday traveler. The objectives of this thesis are to determine
  important functions for airport applications, reveal weaknesses of existing solutions
  and develop a prototype that solves the presented problems. To this end, a criteria
  catalog was developed that covers important features of airport applications. Using
  this catalog, seven selected airport applications were evaluated. As a result, 10
  main features implemented by nearly every tested application were determined. Additionally,
  use case scenarios were developed based on the main features. These scenarios were
  used to analyze the airport applications a second time. The objective of this second
  analysis was to assess the usability through defined heuristics. Results were used
  to develop a prototype that avoids the detected weaknesses. The prototype development
  followed a user-centered design process. First, potential users and their needs
  were identified. The resulting user groups contributed significantly to the design
  process of an appropriate user interface. User tests of the developed design were
  a central element of this process model. The evaluation of existing airport applications
  revealed serious design weaknesses. Even the first draft of the developed prototype
  achieved better results than most tested applications. As part of this thesis, a
  process model is introduced, which presents concrete techniques to create new airport
  applications. The criteria catalog and the process model have been designed for
  the field of airport applications. The applicability of the presented process model
  in different areas of mobile application development is discussed. Finally, relevant
  airport application design guidelines were presented as a guidance for future airport
  application development teams.
