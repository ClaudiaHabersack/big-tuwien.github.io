abstract: For many organizations projects have become a main way to accomplish growth,
  change and value-addition as well as a means of pursuing strategic goals. Project
  Portfolio Management (PPM) is used to maximize the value of an organization&iquest;s
  projects while also aiming at portfolio balance and strategic alignment. A critical
  part of PPM is the Project Portfolio Selection (PPS) which aims at selecting the
  set of projects which fits those goals the best. Although a vast number of PPS approaches
  are discussed in current literature, there exists no sufficiently comprehensive
  overview or a classification model for an easy differentiating and structuring of
  PPS approaches, neither is there a standardized strategy for comparing PPS approaches
  in practice. Different PPS approaches influence the decision making for or against
  the realization of projects and therefore the strategic orientation of an organization.
  Hence a systematic and comprehensible comparison of PPS approaches is of high relevance
  in practice e.g. for subsidiaries of a multinational organization or in post-merger
  situations. The aim of this work was to design a structure for the comparison of
  PPS approaches by assessing, classifying and comparing the employed PPS methods
  and criteria as well as to determine concrete starting points for standardization
  between (subsidiary) organizations. The first step was to conduct an extensive literature
  research to identify current PPS methods and criteria as well as existing classification
  approaches. Next the existing structures for PPS methods and criteria were merged,
  complemented and extended in order to create a new, uniform and comprehensive structure
  for a classification model. In order to allow a flexible application of the model
  for comparing PPS approaches and to obtain differentiated statements about the compared
  approaches, additionally a system of tags for the levels of PPS methods and criteria
  was created. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the classification model,
  a proof of concept was performed at a European insurance company and five of its
  subsidiaries. Using interviews and a questionnaire depicting the designed classification
  model, the respective decision makers were asked to identify the employed PPS methods
  and criteria and furthermore questioned regarding more general PPM aspects. The
  analysis of the collected data showed that the examined sub-organizations principally
  follow a common strategy, yet also divergent aspects regarding the employed PPM
  and PPS could be observed which elucidates the need for a comparison thereof. The
  interviewed decision makers were able to utilize tags of the model structure of
  tags to identify and classify the methods and criteria for the respective PPS approaches.
  Consequently it was demonstrated that the identified element tags can be used to
  compare two or more PPS approaches by applying three suggested similarity measurement
  methods. Hence the proof of concept could be considered successful. Moreover some
  further research topics were identified and pointed out. The designed classification
  model offers a more comprehensive overview than existing approaches on the one hand
  e.g. by including dialectic methods, and furthermore also allows for a more flexible
  and precise classification of PPS approaches through the use of tags.
