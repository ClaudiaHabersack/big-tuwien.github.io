abstract: The increase of software complexity in the field of electronic control for
  diesel engines enforces a rigorously increasing demand in process and software quality
  within the underlying industrial production mechanisms. Meeting these rapidly evolving
  requirements in regard to size of code per engine control as well as to the variety
  and diversity of control tasks made software engineering methodology play an important
  role in the management agenda. Improvements have become necessary in the areas of
  project management, requirement management, software design, configuration management,
  and software quality assurance. Today a higher level of software quality, rather
  well defined processes, and a higher level of accuracy of delivery schedules have
  been achieved by consciously taking ongoing SE improvement steps. Benefits of the
  established software engineering methods have been measured with different metrics.
