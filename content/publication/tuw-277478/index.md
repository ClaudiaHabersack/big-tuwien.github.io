abstract: In 2015, the refugee crisis was one of the biggest challenges for the European
  Union. The refugee camps located in Europe had to coordinate a large number of refugees.
  But there was no common refugee IT infrastructure to establish a refugee registration
  and identification. European Member States had different IT systems and methodologies
  to register and administrate refugees. This paper describes the requirement areas
  and architecture for a standardized refugee management system, applicable in the
  European Union. The requirement areas were evaluated through systematic literature
  review (including official documents from the European Commission) and interviews
  with experts. The main focus of this work is the portability and efficient applicability
  for all Member States. These characteristics should help to react on sudden refugee
  stream changes in a common way. In the case of refugee stream changes, the local
  government has to establish a refugee camp on a specific location and to provide
  a working IT infrastructure. This work proposes a requirement engineering approach
  for an identification, registration and management system applicable in European
  refugee camps.
