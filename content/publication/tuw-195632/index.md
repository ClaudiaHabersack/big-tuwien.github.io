abstract: Based on the definition of the European Commission, small enterprises can
  be defined as companies with less than 50 employees. Medium size companies are companies
  with less than 250 employees. For small and medium enterprises some research in
  regards to ERP selection criteria has been done. But this research did not distinguish
  further in the different behaviors that can be found during the ERP selection process
  within different types of companies. Different characteristics which appear from
  an IT operational point of view on how small and medium size businesses organize
  their IT have not been taken into consideration. This paper gives the definition
  of a specific group of companies named orchestra companies within the SME band.
  This is done by limiting the quite broad definition of the European commission and
  applying an IT operational viewpoint. Further the different requirements of orchestra
  companies in regards to the ERP selection process are formulated. To correlate the
  ERP selection criteria and the different behaviors from an IT operational point
  of view, a segmentation of orchestra companies is developed. For each segment the
  focus on specific ERP selection criteria is discussed. Furthermore is an application
  of the segmentation on technical ERP selection criteria applied.
