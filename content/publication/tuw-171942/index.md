abstract: This study aims to provide additional insight into the area of Software-Metric
  Valida-tion by using a new methodology based on code change analysis. As code changes
  are risky and can be expensive, change data provides an interesting background for
  Quality Management. One of the goals of this work is to provide a model to be able
  to pin-point change occurrence by using Software Metrics. The common methodology
  to validate Software Metrics is by comparing failure data and the metric-generated
  value in statistical analysis. The methodology chosen for this work is to validate
  Software Metrics by using change data instead of failure data. Change data can be
  gathered in an automated fashion, therefore allowing for a big sam-ple size, which
  in turn delivers more cogent conclusions. This change data is referred to as maintenance
  effort in literature. To be able to access a sufficient sample for statistical analysis,
  Open Source projects are used to gather the change data. Two metric suites are employed
  to gather the metric values. Self-written parsers are used to pre-process the data
  for statistical analysis. The statistical method used for validation is regression
  analysis. Two dependent variables are used, Changed Lines and a sum of Non-Commenting
  Source Statements - abbreviated NCSS - and Changed Lines. The metric generated values
  are used as independent variables. A set of Hypotheses, based on assumptions and
  concepts in literature, is pitted against the results of the regression analysis.
  The results show that the more "sophisticated" a metric, i.e. metrics that are more
  complex than others, the less suited it is to predict the dependent variables. The
  possible reasons for this are discussed in this work.
