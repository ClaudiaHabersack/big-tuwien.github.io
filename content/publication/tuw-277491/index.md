abstract: Advances in computer science have raised concerns about the privacy of personal
  information. Therefore solutions to address these concerns have to be found. Blockchain
  enables new approaches to solve privacy issues in distributed systems, but at the
  same time also raises new concerns with its openness and immutability. The European
  Union has taken steps towards addressing information privacy concerns and define
  rights of data subjects and obligations of controllers and processors of personal
  data. We will apply and discuss these in light of current Blockchain implementations.
  This will result in a guideline for GDPR compliant Blockchain developments in the
  future.
