abstract: The faster-growing information society requires a global network of computer
  systems. Thus, the developers are challenged to design new systems and protocols.
  These computer systems have to communicate with each other. This increases the complexity,
  creating security holes that can be exploited by attackers. To protect themselves
  against the tide of attacks, it is necessary, protocols, and services automated
  test. However, since it is not possible to find all errors. Critical applications,
  such as authentication and authorization, will be found and tested. The aim of this
  work is through a real case, the conduct of login and logout a user, to perform
  an automated grammatical analysis of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The results
  of the grammatical analysis show the critical changes in user data over time. The
  results can be used for automated testing of critical applications.
