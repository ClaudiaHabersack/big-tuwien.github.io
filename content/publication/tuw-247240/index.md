abstract: Electronic Invoicing has attracted a lot of attention by being a cornerstone
  of the Digital Agenda for Europe, EuropeÂ´s 2020 Strategy. This agenda mandates a
  "think small first" principle in order to enable e-invoicing for companies of any
  size. The electronic invoice should be exchanged between the ERP systems of business
  partners. Traditional approaches based on electronic data interchange failed to
  attract SMEs. Due to the high costs, they only use e-invoicing if forced by their
  larger business partners. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that
  is based on native ERP integration of most common e-invoice scenarios. This approach
  was successfully implemented in a research project resulting in a university spin-off.
