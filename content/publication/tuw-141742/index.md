abstract: In 1999 UN/CEFACT and OASIS started the ebXML Initiative which delivered
  its first set of specifications 2 years later. This book chapter discusses the goals
  and the results of ebXML. The core of the book chapter addresses a critical evaluation
  of ebXML. It discusses why ebXML was succesful in some parts, but failed in market
  acceptance for major parts.
