abstract: AGILE DEVELOPMENT and distributed software development (DSD) seem like an
  impossible match. Agile processes are designed for collocated teams col- laborating
  closely, which appears incom- patible with DSD and its inherent coor- dination,
  control, and communication challenges.1 Nonetheless, 82 percent of respondents to
  VersionOne Inc.´s 10th Annual State of Agile survey, conducted in 2015, said they
  had at least some dis- tributed teams practicing agile develop- ment, a signi cant
  rise from only 35 per- cent just three years earlier.2 To gather evidence about
  the past and current state of research on teams us- ing both agile and distributed
  develop- ment, three of us conducted a systematic literature review of the topic
  covering 1999 to 2014. (For the review proto- col, see the Web extra at https://extras
  .computer.org/extra/mso201606 0106s1.pdf.) We found an increasing in- terest in
  applying agile practices to DSD from 2004 in the form of anecdotal ex- perience
  reports and from 2010 in the form of evaluation papers, mainly case studies that
  indicated a switch to more rigorous research approaches. However, past research
  seldom fully reported contextual details, omitting information such as team size,
  thus limiting the results´ generalizability. In response, we created a checklist
  for fully reporting the empirical context of case studies on agile DSD, as well
  as general information about projects. (For the checklist, see the Web extra at
  https://extras.computer.org/extra/mso 2016060106s2.pdf.) Also, although past research
  reported lessons learned in agile DSD, no one has created a comprehensive framework
  de- scribing how to apply agile practices to DSD to which both researchers and in-
  dustrial practitioners can relate. We launched our multiyear research project primarily
  to create such a framework- ADAPT (Agile Distributed Adaptable Process Toolkit).
