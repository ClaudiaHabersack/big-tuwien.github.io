<span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black;">The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive model transformation testing framework supporting all testing phases, ranging from test source model generation to fault localization.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black;">Test model generation will be done following a white-box approach, leveraging the code of the transformation to achieve better results.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black;">As the framework is aimed to be generic to any model transformation languages and to any domain-specific language, this opens up challenges such as defining generic coverage criteria.</span>
