abstract: E-voting security does not refer only to the election software which is
  used, but also on the entire infrastructure, including organizational and human
  aspects. To guarantee the security of electronic voting and to minimize the consequences
  of possible security risks, some basic conditions must be defined to ensure confidentiality
  and integrity of data on the one hand and availability of the system on the other
  hand. To verify this thesis, the evoting system of the Austrian Student Union will
  be analyzed with the aid of the security process of the German Federal Agency for
  Security in Information Technology. With this method exemplary threats, which can
  occur during the election process at the client-side, while transmission stage or
  on the server-side, can be defined and evaluated according to their damage potential.
  Finally, the determined security level of the used e-voting system should be optimized
  through selected security measures.
