abstract: 'In the last five years, mobile devices with touchscreens have gained acceptance
  on the mass market. Both the number of sold smartphones and tablets continues to
  rise. Soft-ware development for these mobile devices, however, differs in several
  aspects from previous software development: There are new operating concepts to
  understand and to use - for example, finger gestures or position sensors. In addition,
  software for mobile devices is distributed over new infrastructures and there are
  various ways for developers how to implement mobile software: As a native application,
  as web app or as hybrid app. These new requirements increase the complexity of mobile
  applications in terms of interaction design and planning and therefore they represent
  new challenges for design-ers and programmers. This applied thesis provides an overview
  of factors that play a role in the development of a mobile application. The first
  part of this thesis describes results of current research and development in the
  fields of interaction design, engineering and process models of software development.
  The challenge is to find differences between traditional software development and
  mobile software development, since little research has been done in this area so
  far. The focus of the thesis is on mobile banking apps, so the application domain
  "m-banking" is explained and both conditions and useful tools for modern m-banking
  appli-cations are described. Besides these conditions there are criteria that should
  be considered for the graphical and technological design of a mobile banking app:
  usability, accessibility, responsive-ness, performance and security. These general
  criteria for mobile software here refer specifically to the creation of a mobile
  banking application. A case study in this thesis is an actually developed mobile
  banking app, which in addition to conventional banking services (transfers or balance
  inquiry) also offers additional functionality (eg, a branch-finder). Details of
  design decisions and the implementation phase are described, which are related to
  the previously defined criteria and also were determining factors for the final
  version of the application. It turns out that the development of a successful m-banking
  app should be done in a uniform process from the idea to the distribution on the
  market. Reason for that is the close coupling of interaction design, engineering,
  development models and sales within the respective operating systems (Android or
  iOS). Another important point is a good understanding of the technical possibilities
  of modern mobile devices, and the needs of an application in terms of usability.'
