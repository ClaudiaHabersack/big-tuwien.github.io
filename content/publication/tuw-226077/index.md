abstract: The complexity of IT systems and the criticality of robust IT systems is
  constantly increasing. Testing a system requires consideration of different protocols
  and interfaces, which makes testing hard and expensive. Test automation is required
  to improve the quality of systems without cost explosion. Many standards like HTML
  and FTP are semi-formally defined in RFCs, which makes a generic algorithm for test
  data generation based on RFC relevant. The proposed approach makes it possible to
  automatically generate test data for protocols defined as ABNF in RFCs for robustness
  tests. The introduced approach was shown in practice by generating SIP messages
  based on the RFC specification of SIP. This approach shows the possibility to generate
  data for any RFC that uses ABNF, and provides a solid foundation for further empirical
  evaluation and extension for software testing purposes.
