abstract: In the last years there has been an continuing trend to process more and
  more sensible data over the internet. In this safety-critical environment it must
  be possible to guarantee safety objectives like confidentiality, integrity or confirmability.
  XML security is an XML based standard that offers the possiblity to ensure this
  safety aspects. As web services are XML based too in general, this standard is applied
  frequently. Beside the application of suitable security standards finding and fixing
  security vulnerabilities is a central aspect to ensure data security. Extensive
  testing is therefore essential. In this paper several techniques for finding flaws
  in design documents, program code or application configurations are presented. Thereby
  static and dynamic techniques, as well as white box and black box techniques are
  presented. Each of them having their assets and drawbacks relating to discovery
  of different classes of software defects. This paper focusses on testing of safety-critical
  applications with fuzzing. For this purpose an existing fuzzing framework is extended
  with functions for XML security and applied to an actual application.
