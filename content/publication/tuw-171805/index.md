abstract: One of the most exciting evolutions in the internet over the last years
  is the spread of social networks. No other genre of web services has such high expansion
  rates like the social networking sphere. MySpace, LinkedIn, Orkut or Facebook have
  gained enormous popularity over the past years because of a steadily increasing
  demand for communication and collaboration among users. Forced by the fast evolution
  of the internet, innovative web technologies and networking functionalities, the
  user changed from a passive information consumer to an active content producer and
  distributor. As a key success factor, social networking services offer modern communication
  possibilities for people by supporting user interaction and data interchange. This
  paper presents a snapshot of the social networking sphere attained by an extensive
  site analysis. As a main focus, current trends, key functionalities and revenue
  models of successful social networks were identified and analyzed in detail. To
  contribute to the development of successful next generation social networks and
  web services, the presented trend-setting movements are crucial for meeting the
  demands of modern users.
