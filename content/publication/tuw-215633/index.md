abstract: Over the last few years there has been a rapid rise in the number of people
  carrying powerful computers in their pockets. By mid 2011, more than half of all
  mobile phones used in Europe and North America were smartphones. The range of possibilities
  and opportunities opened up by this recent development is immense. This thesis focuses
  on the gastronomy industry in terms of addressing business transactions utilizing
  smartphones and similar technological advances. At the beginning of this work researches
  and reviews were undertaken concerning products currently on the market which are
  used to simplify transactions with a focus on the consumer. Based on this research
  a concept for an innovative system with its core in smartphone client usage was
  developed. One of the key features of this system is that consumers are able to
  order and pay for their food without interaction with a waiter. The main advantage
  for consumers is to save time. The only element that can not be influenced is the
  time it takes to prepare the food. A sociological study was then carried out researching
  the user acceptance of this concept. Four out of five participants in the study
  stated that they would be interested in ordering food with their smartphone while
  in a restaurant. Nine out of ten participants would preorder food for later consumption
  in a restaurant. Once the interest in this concept has been established, a prototype
  of the smartphone client has been developed for the iOS operating system. With all
  significant features in place, a usability study was then undertaken. One of the
  aims of the aforementioned study was to find flaws in the prototype, while another
  aim was to receive valuable feedback not only on the usability but also on the concept
  as a whole. The majority of the surveyed expressed a greater willingness to choose
  a restaurant partaking in such a system.
