abstract: Inter-organizational B2B systems are most likely tending to change their
  business requirements over time - e.g. establishing new partnerships or change existing
  ones. The problem is that business analysts design the business processes from scratch,
  disregarding the economic drivers of the business network. We propose to use business
  modeling techniques - such as REA (Resource-Event-Agents) - to ensure that business
  processes beneath do not violate the domain rules, i.e. to ful ll the basic economic
  principle for every business transaction - the give-andtake convention, called economic
  reciprocity. This helps us to quickly adapt the B2B processes to changing requirements
  without the need to change the overall architecture. In this paper we provide a
  mapping from REA, which represents one of the most prominent ontologies for business
  modeling, to UMM (UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology), a standardized methodology
  for modeling the global choreography of interorganizational business processes.
  We formalize the mapping by the use of the model-to-model transformation language
  ATL (Atlas Transformation Language).
