abstract: 'Wayfinding aids communicate route and survey knowledge to help the user
  reach a distant goal. This knowledge can be objectified and transmitted using different
  media, e.g. through maps or verbal instructions. This work investigates web applications
  as technical medium for wayfinding aids: The focus of this work is the design of
  a new online wayfinding aid for students, teachers, and visitors at the Vienna University
  of Technology. One challenge with indoor route descriptions is that they will often
  include three-dimensional instructions such as when to change into a particular
  floor. These instructions can be described verbally in a comprehensible way, but
  are difficult to depict graphically together with a street map. As a solution, this
  work proposes to place two-dimensional floorplan images over a regular street map,
  and to add additional, verbal instructions concerning the floor levels. Usability
  Engineering methods have been employed in this work. It is structured by an iterative
  design process where prototyping and evaluation are used repeatedly during the design
  phase. The process kept a focus on users by involving them in interviews and usability
  tests. This work results in a prototype of a campus wayfinding aid built as a web
  application. The prototype features an interactive, two-dimensional street map with
  floorplans, and photos, text, and a hypertext structure. The interaction design
  of the prototype offers several different ways of accessing the system: navigation
  on the map, textual search, hyperlinks from other systems, and browsing in the hypertext
  structure. In summary, the work at hand provides an overview on relevant wayfinding
  theory and employs usability engineering methods for the construction of a prototype.
  It thereby offers a detailed specification of the content, appearance and interaction
  of an online campus wayfinding aid.'
