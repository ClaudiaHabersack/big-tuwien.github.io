abstract: Mobile financial services have become increasingly interesting for banks
  as well as their customers during the last years. On the one hand it provides an
  additional distribution channel for banks, which they can use to improve customer
  service, on the other hand it enables users to manage their financial affairs from
  virtually anywhere, anytime. This master thesis describes the design and evaluation
  of a mobile banking application's user interface for smartphones utilizing touch-sensitive
  displays. To achieve this, a user-centered design process is employed and the characteristics
  of mobile devices are considered from the view of interaction design. Mobile devices
  impose special requirements on user interfaces through their form factor and usage
  pattern. This work introduces the special features of the mobile media and provides
  appropriate interaction design principles as well as methods for design and evaluation.
  m-banking is a complex process, consisting of a number of different processes that
  can be categorized into mobile accounting, mobile brokerage and mobile financial
  information. The most important use cases from the view of customers as well as
  banks are acquired through an extensive literature review. Subsequently, existing
  e-banking and m-banking solutions are analyzed to acquire current banking processes
  and best practices. Based on these foundations, the goal was to design a useful
  and usable user interface for an m-banking application for the core target user
  groups, young and agile early adopters and long-term e-banking users. The interface
  was designed and tested iteratively with potential target users and thus represents
  successfully evaluated solution for m-banking applications on smartphones with touchscreens.
