abstract: The use of information and communication technologies as teaching aids for
  educational purposes has increased enormously during the last decades. Since applied
  computer science has become compulsory in the school system of Austria, there were
  new requirements for performing maintenance and repairing computer systems used
  in teaching environments. The most important task is to provide an efficient and
  reliable solution for software installation as software installation is most frequently
  needed due to the fact that operating systems cannot thoroughly prevent damage to
  local disk data. As networks usually exist in modern computer infrastructures, the
  process of software installation can be automated for a whole classroom by using
  broadcast or multicast data transfer. In this thesis a reliable multicast protocol
  is introduced, designed for the special case of software distribution in educational
  computer networks, and evaluated in the face of usability for this special purpose.
