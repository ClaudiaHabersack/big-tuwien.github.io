abstract: The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the continuous use of
  digital construction models from the planning stage onwards. The affected processes
  are iterative and involve multiple stakeholders who work at varying pace and in
  varying levels of detail. These stakeholders require highly specific tools based
  on diverging data models. To satisfy all those equirements one of the best known
  Open BIM implementations - IFC - offers a data model containing more than one thousand
  different types - from basic to highly specific. Due to its complexity, potential
  users must undergo prolonged training. The even bigger challenge for IFC, however,
  is keeping up with the updates of building regulations or with the ever expanding
  state of the art in simulation tools. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC,
  consist of 26 different basic types. They can be combined to increasingly complex
  models, which can themselves be used as types for other models. This enables each
  domain expert to create a custom data structure for any specific task, which is
  automatically compatible with the data structure of any other domain expert using
  the same basic types. It shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-,
  and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key
  aspect of BIM. As a use case, we present the calculation of the U-Value of a multi-layered
  wall. We compare number, complexity and adequacy of the necessary data modelling
  steps in IFC4 and in SIMULTAN. The result shows that the flexible data model of
  SIMULTAN can be better adapted to the task. Another significant advantage of SIMULTAN
  is its inbuilt separation of responsibilities at the level of the most basic types,
  which, when combined with secure transaction technologies, can enable safe, effective
  and easily traceable interaction among stakeholders.
