abstract: In small software companies the achievement of the strategic goal "increasing
  customer satisfaction" is compromised by limited resources. Nevertheless there is
  a chance to increase cutomer satisfaction with improving software processes and
  therefore increasing product quality. Software process improvement (SPI) considering
  the limited resources starts with an lightweighted assessment, to collect the current
  status of the processes in the company. If the company starts to be engaged with
  SPI, they need support on the execution of the first assessment. The scope of this
  work is to highlight the problems of small enterprises in executing the first assessment
  when they initiate SPI. Resulting, a lightweighted assessment method, which is intended
  for the first assessment in a small company, is designed. This assessment method
  is based on Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) - Continuous Representation
  to increase process and product quality and to structure the processes to have the
  abilitiy of measuring them in the future. A case study illustrates the implementation
  of the designed assessment method. The assessment method is implemented in a relative
  autonomous division of an international software enterprise. The aim is to identify
  the current software processes, to analyze them with the assessment method and finally
  to define concrete activities to improve the processes.
