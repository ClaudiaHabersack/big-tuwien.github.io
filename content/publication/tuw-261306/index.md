abstract: '"Industrie 4.0" aims at flexible production networks that require horizontal
  integration across companies. Evidently, any production related information exchanged
  in the network must be vertically forwarded to the corresponding service endpoints
  of the local production system. Accordingly, there is a need to align information
  that flows between companies and within each company. The Resource-Event-Agent (REA)
  business ontology describes a metamodel for internal business activities (e.g.,
  production) and for inter-organizational exchange constellations on the enterprise
  resource planning (ERP) level. ISA-95 is a series of standards targeting the integration
  of enterprise control systems on the interface between ERP systems and manufacturing
  execution systems. Consequently, we align elements of REA and ISA-95 and define
  conversion rules for the transformation of elements from one system to the other.
  By interleaving the semantics of both standards, we formally strengthen the links
  between the services of the business level and the production level, and support
  multi-system adaptation in flexible production environments.'
