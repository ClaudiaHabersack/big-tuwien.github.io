abstract: Based on the theoretical basics of Graphic- and Web-Design, four design
  drafts for "TU-Wien Informations-Systeme und Services" (TISS) are presented in this
  work. TISS is a development project hosted by the Vienna University of Technology
  which seeks to implement information and communication systems for teaching, research
  and business. For the web channel, the design of an interface is needed that, on
  the one hand enables to model all functions of the system beneath, and on the other
  hand gives the user the ability to achieve his tasks with efficiency and effectiveness.
  To accomplish a rich visual communication, practices, experience and techniques
  from the print-design are mapped to the medium of web. Thus the inherent aspects
  of the latter are enriched. With this goal in mind, the theoretical basics of graphical
  modeling are described from the viewpoint of Web-Design. The human visual recognition
  is shaped by the knowledge of space and form as well as by certain design principles,
  color and pictures. For web designing tasks it is crucial to know the typical structure
  of a website, navigation elements, typical web layouts, grid systems and wireframes.
  Typographical elements such as letters, words, lines visualized in a practical context
  are the basis of nearly every communication. With user centered design and usability
  methods the user steps into the focus of attention. No design decisions happen without
  considering the user. On the basis of these theoretical aspects, four Designs are
  presented. With references to the theory the chosen design approach is described
  and the requirements are presented. The central part however is the presentation
  of the achieved results with special focus on the finally chosen design work. A
  connection between theory and implementation is drawn, and the importance and benefit
  of rich visual communication elucidated.
