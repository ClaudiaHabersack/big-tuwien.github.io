abstract: The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology is a powerful and well accepted
  approach towards the design of accounting information systems (AIS). However, the
  REA notation - that is currently based on class diagrams - is not very intuitive
  for business experts. Accordingly, we aim at a REA domain specific modeling language
  that facilitates the communication between business experts and IT professionals.
  In previous work we defined the REA-DSL operational layer reflecting actual business
  events which "have occurred" or "are occurring". In this paper we extend the REA-DSL
  by the planning layer capturing what future events "are scheduled" or "are planned"
  by commitments. Now, our REA-DSL covers all basic concepts to describe a full accounting
  infrastructure. The REA-DSL may serve as a solid basis for generating a conceptual
  AIS data model - which is subject to future work.
