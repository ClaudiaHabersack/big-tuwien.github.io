Erwan Bousse is a post-doc researcher who obtained his PhD in France in 2015 at the [University of Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english), [IRISA/Inria lab](http://www.irisa.fr/en), [DiverSE team](http://diverse.irisa.fr/), under the supervision of [Benoît Baudry](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Benoit.Baudry/) and [Benoît Combemale](http://people.irisa.fr/Benoit.Combemale/).

His [thesis](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01238005) focused on providing means to enable the dynamic V&amp;V of executable models, such as efficient model cloning, the creation of multi-dimensional execution traces of executable models, and the use of such traces for advanced model omniscient debugging.

### Interests

*   model transformation
*   verification of model transformations
*   language engineering
*   model execution
*   dynamic verification and validation of executable models
*   execution traces of executable models

### Current work
