abstract: Personal Data, concerning unique individuals, requires accurate treatment
  ever since. To avoid the disclosure of these unique individuals through the exploit
  of personal data during electronic ex- change, certain steps can be taken, including
  anonymization- and pseudonymization-techniques. In the first instance we focus on
  the comparison of current anonymization- and pseudonymization- techniques and then
  continue with the proposal for a verifying-component which is going to be rea- lized
  within the scope of a case-study at the Technical University of Vienna. Purpose
  of the compo- nent is the delivery of a decision-base for the peer-to-peer exchange
  of medical data so no unique individuals can be identified during the exploit of
  this data. Therefore the component assures a cer- tain standard of pseudonymity
  for the medical data in regards of diversity and anonymity. Finally a proposal for
  the verifying-component is made in the last section of this scientific work. Re-
  search showed that current anonymization and pseudonymization methods are insufficient
  in terms of security and attacks on them, so that a maximum level of security cannot
  be guaranteed at this point of time.
