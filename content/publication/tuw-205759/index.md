abstract: Multi-touch tabletop systems promise to enhance collaboration in  multi-display
  (MDE) environments. However, little is known about the effects  of combining shared
  multi-touch tabletops with multi-touch tablet computers  (tablets) as the collaborators'
  personal displays. In this paper we present the  implementation of a MDE with multi-touch
  input on both shared and personal  displays and its evaluation regarding task performance,
  user preferences and  collaboration strategies compared to a standard multi-touch
  tabletop setting.  Eight participant pairs had to solve a collaborative sorting
  task using three  different transfer techniques. Based on an analysis of video recordings,
  log files  and user feedback we identified task solving and collaboration strategies.
  The  use of tablets enabled participants to follow diverse strategies and participants  preferred
  the collaboration using tablets, while overall task performance and the  amount
  of close collaboration were higher without the tablets.
