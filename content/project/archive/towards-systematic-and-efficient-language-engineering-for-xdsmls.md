### Topic

Domain-specific modeling languages are increasingly being developed to continuously leverage the domain-specific expertise of the various stakeholders involved in the development of complex software-intensive system as, for instance, found in the automation, production, and automotive domains. Although there are many examples of the successful adoption of DSMLs to improve development productivity and system quality, it has been also recognized that the development of DSMLs is itself a challenging and significant software engineering task. In this project, we focus on challenges associated with the development of executable DSMLs (xDSMLs) that support the model-level analysis of complex systems through model execution. In particular, the main goal of this project is to develop a systematic approach for engineering xDSMLs facilitating the automated development of domain-specific model analysis tooling for xDSMLs.
