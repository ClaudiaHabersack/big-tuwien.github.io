abstract: Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is based on the standardization of business
  document types. Usually, a standard business document type is defined in an all-embracing
  manner covering all elements needed in any business context, such as geopolitical
  context, industry context, and others. Before exchanging business documents in a
  particular business context, business partners have to agree on an implementation
  guide resulting in a subset of the standard document type. Different subsets of
  a standard document type may also be considered as variants of the standard document
  type. Since no agreed methodology for building variants of standard documents types
  exists, the domain of EDI may learn from Software Engineering. In fact, we are facing
  the need for managing variants which is typically addressed in Software Configuration
  Management. In this position paper, we propose utilizing concepts from Product Line
  Engineering (PLE) for managing variability in business document models. Therefore,
  we present the challenges encountered in managing variability in business documents.
  Furthermore, we provide a profound discussion why concepts from PLE are promising
  for managing business document variants.
