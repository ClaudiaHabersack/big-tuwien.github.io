abstract: The necessity of software evolution caused by novel requirements is often
  triggered alongside the advancement of underlying languages and tools.  Although
  modern language workbenches decrease the opportunity cost of creating new language
  implementations, they do not offer automated and complete integration of existing
  languages. Moreover, they still require complex language engineering skills and
  extensive manual implementation effort to suit the expectations of domain experts,
  e.g., in terms of editor capabilities. In this work we present XMLIntellEdit---a
  framework for evolving domain-specific languages by automating the generation of
  modernized languages offering advanced editing capabilities, such as extended validation,
  content-assist, and quick fix solutions. Our approach builds on techniques from
  Model-Driven Engineering and Search-based Software Engineering research. Initial
  results indicate that XML Schema definitions containing restrictions can be applied
  for the automated generation of advanced editing facilities.
