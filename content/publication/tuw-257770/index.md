abstract: Software evolution is an active eld of research and has featured many different
  approaches to learn more about the processes and people that drive software engineering
  eorts. Recent studies have further advanced research on software evolution by incorporating
  Natural Language Processing method- ologies to mine textual artifacts accessible
  in repositories like Bug Tracking Systems and Version Control Systems for information
  about the nature of software engineering. We propose a methodology called SubCat
  that exploits Natural Language Processing and data mining capabilities to provide
  a framework that provides both researchers and managers access to software evolution
  meta-data contained within their repositories. The proposed methodology incorporates
  in its design the current state of the art in the mining of software repositories
  and answers de ned problems with current tool support. We apply the resulting framework
  in dierent scenarios to validate the methods eciency. In these scenarios various
  aspects of software evolution were analyzed, new ndings could be made and existing
  assumptions partially refuted. The methodology was applied to cover a broad range
  of topics from classi cation of code changes to using Sentiment Analysis on comments
  in a bug tracker. Further, the methodology was used to identify security-relevant
  changes, which could be validated by using existing Security Advisories. Additionally,
  we employ the framework to generate content for a Bug Tracker based on information
  available in a Code Repository to showcase a potential use for projects that did
  not start out with a Bug Tracker. Aside the mentioned scenarios, we created a classi
  cation mechanism for code changes into maintenance categories and evaluated it for
  cross-project validity. The dictionary and the provided Sentiment Analysis capabilities
  of the framework were then used to generate developer pro les to showcase a potential
  use for future studies on longterm developer motivation or dashboards for project
  managers to see possible con icts and problems at a glance.
