abstract: The simultaneous use of more than two different data sources from the software
  engineering toolset is still uncommon in the research areas of software evolution
  and visualization. In our work, we address this research gap by the design and evaluation
  of three interactive visualizations which combine the data from the version control
  (VCS), the issue tracking (ITS), and the continuous integration (CI) system. After
  analyzing the information needs of a project team and describing the available data,
  we selected change impact, code ownership, and activity peaks as our visualization
  topics. Then, we adapted suitable visualization techniques from the literature to
  meet our design requirements. After implementation, we evaluated our visualizations
  by conducting a usability test with ten senior software engineers. On the system
  usability scale (SUS), our visualizations achieved the rating "good" from the participants.
  A scenario success rate of 88% and the qualitative user feedback has provided evidence
  for the benefits of visualizing combined data from the VCS, ITS, and CI system.
