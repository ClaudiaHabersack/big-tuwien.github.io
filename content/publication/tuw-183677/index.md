abstract: This diploma thesis deals with the problem that workflows of software developing
  organisations are getting more and more complicated. Because of the absence of exhaustive
  documentation especially new employees are in danger of forgetting necessary work
  steps. Usually work steps which are legally important and do not have an immediate
  effect on the process or the project are affected. The documentation of activities
  done on a server belonging to a customer is an example therefore. This lapse may
  be prevented by using a workflow-management-system. This diploma thesis shows how
  to create documentation, gather and analyze processes and how to integrate these
  processes into a dynamic system for the workflow execution. There is a particular
  focus on supporting users at their daily work in a way that makes them do their
  work faster or with a higher quality respectively. Based the case study of the IT-Department
  of a medium-sized organisation a workflow-management-system which should fulfill
  these tasks will be designed and engineered. In the course of the implementation
  of the workflow-management-system at the organisation responsibilities and rough
  process structures were defined and the creation of an exhaustive documentation
  of the processes was arranged. In order to maintain the user satisfaction the workflow-management-system
  was integrated into an existing system for documenting working hours. Using the
  timestamps created by both systems it is now possible to create charts for the process
  performance which may be used to optimize the workflows and to allow resource planning's
  for future projects respectively. Finally an evaluation based on a self designed
  questionnaire took place.
