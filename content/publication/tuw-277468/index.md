abstract: Over the past few years, the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
  systems in our daily lives has increased and, therefore, they are becoming a target
  for attackers trying to obtain benefits from such systems. However, VoIP extends
  the existent risk range of other protocols over the Internet and presents new attacks
  as well. To obtain insights of VoIP attackers and increase VoIP security, researchers
  use security measures, e.g., honeypots or honeynets to capture and analyze VoIP
  attacks over the Internet. The collected data, recorded over a long period of time
  by a honeynet VoIP system already implemented, were used to analyze VoIP security
  threats by studying the several millions of real-world attacks collected. Based
  on this real-world collected data from the honeynet, a concept was proposed to identify
  VoIP attackers using behavior analysis and identification methods. The concept proposes
  a hybrid data-mining technique for attacker identification based on a combination
  of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means
  for clustering algorithm and Naïve Bayes for classification algorithm. The difference
  between the results of both clustering algorithms was presented. Each clustering
  algorithm produces attackers sig- natures or clusters and each cluster corresponds
  to one or more attackers´ activities. This hybrid approach is able to identify them
  and presents the probability result that the new attacker is one already known by
  the concept system. The data collected from honeynets with some additional information
  has been used to create a dataset in the proposed concept. The goal of this thesis
  is to provide a deeper insight into the collected data in order to identify VoIP
  attackers. The effectiveness of the concept is demonstrated with a Proof-of-Concept
  (PoC) implementation that was developed as part of this work. The PoC delivered
  some interesting and promising results which support the potential of the concept
  to identify attackers based on their behavior.
