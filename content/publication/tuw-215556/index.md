abstract: This paper reports on a between-subject, comparative online study of three
  information visualization demonstrators that each displayed the same dataset by
  way of an identical scatterplot technique, yet were different in style in terms
  of visual and interactive embellishment. We validated stylistic adherence and integrity
  through a separate experiment in which a small cohort of participants assigned our
  three demonstrators to predefined groups of stylistic examples, after which they
  described the styles with their own words. From the online study, we discovered
  significant differences in how participants execute specific interaction operations,
  and the types of insights that followed from them. However, in spite of significant
  differences in apparent usability, enjoyability and usefulness between the style
  demonstrators, no variation was found on the self-reported depth, expert-rated depth,
  confidence or difficulty of the resulting insights. Three different methods of insight
  analysis have been applied, revealing how style impacts the creation of insights,
  ranging from higher-level pattern seeking to a more reflective and interpretative
  engagement with content, which is what underlies the patterns. As this study only
  forms the first step in determining how the impact of style in information visualization
  could be best evaluated, we propose several guidelines and tips on how to gather,
  compare and categorize insights through an online evaluation study, particularly
  in terms of analyzing the concise, yet wide variety of insights and observations
  in a trustworthy and reproducable manner.
