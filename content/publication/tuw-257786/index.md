abstract: During user tests of high-tech prostheses, test managers are very busy with
  tasks like monitoring the correct application of the prosthesis, detecting incorrect
  walking patterns, dealing with the prosthetic user, as well as (re)adjusting the
  prosthesis configuration and documenting system failures. Due to the vast amount
  of sensor data, it is hard to find short events within the monitored sensor data
  and to identify and extract the set of sensor data that were captured during a problematic
  functioning of the prosthesis. Therefore, it is important to have tools which are
  capable of monitoring the sensor information of the prosthesis in a very user friendly
  and widely automatic way in order to draw inferences from sensor data about possible
  problems with the use of the prosthesis. In this work, it was investigated whether
  mobile platforms are able to contribute to the field of gait- and sensor analysis
  from external sources like a high-tech prosthesis. Using mobile platforms instead
  of classical computer desktops could improve the efficiency of user tests and contribute
  to the flexibility of an engineer&iquest;s work during maintenance and development
  tasks. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on the Android platform
  which enables the capabilities of communicating with a high-tech microprocessor-
  controlled prosthesis in order to transmit, store and analyze data including 3D-position,
  acceleration data, joint angles and many more. In order to make a link between the
  monitored sensor data and the physical activities of the prosthetic user, the proposed
  system is able to record video material simultaneously. The prototype implementation
  has been evaluated and tested in the context of user tests performed by the target
  user group. Finally, we give a short outlook on future work as well as possible
  optimizations of the prototype.
