abstract: The operating system Android is with almost 85% market share worldwide in
  a leading position and the Android Google Play Store counts around 2.8 million mobile
  applications. However, the threats these applications involve remain often untold.
  In the last few years publications and tools with a focus on security areas such
  as communication, cryptography and data access or data storage have been published.
  To compose the functionality of different analysis tools and to accomplish an automated
  security classification of Android applications with a focus on IT-Security, a web-based
  Testing as a Service (TaaS) framework has been implemented, which integrates various
  existing security analysis tools. Based on the analysis results of the integrated
  tools and the recommendations of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
  Top 10 as well as the rules of the CERT Department of the Software Engineering Institute
  of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) the framework identifies the security class
  of the analyzed applications. In order to identify the most common security threats
  and issues, the most secure and vulnerable Google Play Store categories as well
  as the changes in the security field of cryptography in the last six years, an evaluation
  was conducted as part of the thesis to automatically determine the security of 100
  android applications from 58 different Google Play Store categories that include
  categories such as Android Wear, Business or Finance. Analyzing the 5.800 Google
  Play Store applications using the framework attached tools as well as the security
  classification of the defined categories Insufficient Attack Protection, Security
  Invalidation, Access Control, Sensitive Data Leakage and Input Validation resulted
  in at least one security issue in about 76% of the evaluated applications. The result
  of critical or insecure classified applications varied in different Google Play
  Store categories, with lower rates of critical applications found in security-critical
  categories such as Business, Family Education, Finance and Medical. Most of the
  issues were located in the Security Invalidation category or more precisely in the
  areas of Certificate Validation and Cryptography. In the field of Cryptography rules
  concerning the usage of Electronic Code Book Mode (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining Mode
  (CBC) with non-random Initialization Vector (IV) as well as static seeds have been
  evaluated and resulted overall in a decline of problems in the past six years.
