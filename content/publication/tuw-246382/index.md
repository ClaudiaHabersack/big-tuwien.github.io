abstract: 'Mobile applications provide increasingly complex functionality through
  form-based user interfaces, which requires effective solutions for navigation on
  small-screen devices. This paper contributes a comparative usability evaluation
  of four navigation design patterns: Scrolling, Tabs, Menus, and Collapsible Fieldsets.
  These patterns were evaluated in a case study on social network profile pages. Results
  show that memorability, usability, overview, and subjective preference were worse
  in Scrolling than in the other patterns. This indicates that designers of form-based
  user interfaces on small-screen devices should not rely on Scrolling to support
  navigation, but use other design patterns instead.'
