abstract: The area of tangible user interfaces (TUI) has spread widely in the last
  few years and its significance is continuously growing. TUIs support human tactile
  cognition in a natural way by visualizing digital information through physical representations.
  Therefore manipulations of real objects influence directly their virtual embodiments
  in the system. Depending on the TUI application nearly any object can be digitally
  enhanced and used as a tangible control device. The handling of TUIs is intuitive
  and does not require long instructions. Furthermore the interactive input method
  facilitates cooperation in groups. Yet no common standard has been established among
  its various interface implementa-tions. At the same time commercial implementations
  are still subject to high costs and tight licensing issues. In the context of this
  diploma thesis the Tangible Table ToolkiT (4T) framework is presented as a low priced
  alternative to conventional TUI systems and described in detail as well as its underlying
  technologies. Provided by the research group for Industrial Software (INSO) it serves
  as a design tool for developing TUI applications, in particular for tangible tabletops.
  Together with the 4T rear projection table the framework builds an innovative TUI
  system on site. In addition differences between TUIs and GUIs are comparatively
  discussed. This thesis focuses on the detailed technical description and intensive
  analysis of the 4T framework as well as its expansion by adding reacTIVision. In
  the course of the 4T project a framework has been established which offers various
  approaches for designing TUI-based applications. Prerequisites for this purpose
  are both the implementation of optical tracking technologies (ARToolKit, reacTIVision)
  and the usage of another extensible framework (OpenTracker). Another concerning
  matter regards the didactical relevance of physical embodiments and manipulations
  to generate intuitive computer interfaces on the basis of cognitive science. Designers
  do not need to be experienced programmers. They can concentrate their efforts on
  putting their ideas into action. Furthermore it provides reliable background information
  as a guideline for the design of new TUI systems.
