abstract: Current research on historical project data is rarely touching on the subject
  of security related information. Learning how security is treated in projects and
  which parts of a software are historically security relevant or prone to security
  changes can enhance the security strategy of a software project. We present a mining
  methodology for security related changes by modifying an existing method of software
  repository analysis. We use the gathered security changes to find out more about
  the nature of security in the FreeBSD project and we try to establish a link between
  the identified security changes and a tracker for security issues (security advisories).
  We give insights how security is presented in the FreeBSD project and show how the
  mined data and known security problems are connected.
