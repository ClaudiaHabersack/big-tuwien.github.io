abstract: This textbook mainly addresses beginners and readers with a basic knowledge
  of object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#, but with little or no
  modeling or software engineering experience - thus reflecting the majority of students
  in introductory courses at universities. Using UML, it introduces basic modeling
  concepts in a highly precise manner, while refraining from the interpretation of
  rare special cases.  After a brief explanation of why modeling is an indispensable
  part of software development, the authors introduce the individual diagram types
  of UML (the class and object diagram, the sequence diagram, the state machine diagram,
  the activity diagram, and the use case diagram), as well as their interrelationships,
  in a step-by-step manner. The topics covered include not only the syntax and the
  semantics of the individual language elements, but also pragmatic aspects, i.e.,
  how to use them wisely at various stages in the software development process. To
  this end, the work is complemented with examples that were carefully selected for
  their educational and illustrative value.  Overall, the book provides a solid foundation
  and deeper understanding of the most important object-oriented modeling concepts
  and their application in software development. An additional website (www.uml.ac.at)
  offers a complete set of slides to aid in teaching the contents of the book, exercises
  and further e-learning material.
