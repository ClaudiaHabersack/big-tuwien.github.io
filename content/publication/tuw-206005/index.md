abstract: Since companies have started using enterprise information systems to operate
  their business processes, the operational structure of the organization has become
  more and more relevant. Business Process Management (BPM) has emerged as a new discipline
  which combines methods to analyze, shape, improve and establish the business processes
  of the organization. Analyzing and optimizing the business processes becomes even
  more important when implementing new information systems. Likewise the information
  systems should fit the existing business processes. The Vienna University of Technology
  (TU) is currently adopting a new IT strategy called "TU Informations-Systeme und
  Services" (TISS, TU information systems and services). One goal of TISS is to reengineer
  and unify many of the isolated information systems in use at the TU. This thesis
  will show that BPM methods can be successfully used in a large administrative institution
  like the Vienna University of Technology. In three case studies processes and information
  systems of the TISS project will be analyzed, improved, specified and, if possible,
  established as workflows.
