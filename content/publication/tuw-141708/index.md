abstract: After a description of current developments in the area of eGovernment,
  this work analyses the model of electronic delivery in Austria. This model only
  supports the electronic delivery of documents and requires that the addressee is
  registered at an electronic delivery service. Since in Austria so far only very
  few people use such a service, the benefit for authorities is small because in most
  cases a postal delivery is needed. So there is the need to extend the existing model
  to support a postal delivery. After an analysis of the electronic delivery model,
  the requirements for the so-called "dual delivery" are identified. Also the advantages
  of a dual delivery are shown. Based on the requirements a conception is made which
  covers the integration into the existing model, processes of the dual delivery model,
  the description of a postal delivery service as also a description of required extensions
  on the interfaces and required changes on the data structures. Thus the conception
  builds the basis for further detail specifications.
