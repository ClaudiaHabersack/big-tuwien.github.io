abstract: The refugee crisis in 2015 was one of the biggest challenges for the European
  Union. The refugee camps had to face an enormous organization and coordination effort
  in several Member States. Furthermore, no standardized way for registering and identifying
  refugees in European refugee camps was present. Each Member State had and still
  have different IT systems and methods to coordinate refugees in their territory.
  Hence, the authors already proposed a standardized refugee management system applicable
  in European refugee camps. This concept suggests the application of QR code bracelets
  for registering refugees when arriving in front of the camp. This requirement was
  the source of several discussions about ethical issues that can apply when giving
  refugees ID bracelets. This paper describes these ethical issues that can arise
  using such an identification method. With the aid of a quantitative survey, done
  with refugees and nongovernmental organizations, the authors identified the fundamental
  issue that causes this dilemma. Furthermore, this paper describes possible solutions
  which may reduce the negative impact provoked by such identification and registration
  systems.
