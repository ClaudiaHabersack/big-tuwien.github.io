abstract: Mobile phones have developed from communication devices to multifunctional
  information portals. With wireless near field communication (NFC) they can now even
  be used as electronic purses to conduct mobile payments (m-payment). The first part
  of this thesis covers the basics of payment methods and data transfer technologies.
  The main focus is on the identification of security threats and the development
  of a criteria catalogue that will help to increase consumer acceptance of mobile
  contactless payment. This catalogue is built on studies and surveys performed with
  mobile contactless payment users as well as scientific publications about security
  issues of data transfers. This thesis shows that there are several unresolved security
  issues with mobile contactless payment that need to be addressed before a successful
  introduction is possible. Some of the major elements are secure communication, functional
  NFC devices (mobile phone, token, card...), technically mature software, prevention
  of application errors, protection of confidential information and also the compliance
  with renowned security standards. Summarised it is shown, that only by complying
  with the criteria catalogue the acceptance of mobile contactless payment can be
  significantly increased.
