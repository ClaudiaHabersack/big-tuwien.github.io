abstract: Starting point/Motivation Studies show that there is significant potential
  for efficiency gain in energy systems encompassing not just a single building but
  entire building complexes. However, the expectations of building developers, operators
  and residents regarding performance (incl. energy cost, comfort, etc.) could not
  be met. The difficulties in the planning and construction process and the unexpected
  effects on energy supply systems can generally be traced back to the lack of insight
  and understanding of complex resource and energy efficient systems and to communication
  problems among the involved stakeholders. Contents and Objectives Currently, there
  is a shortage of appropriate tools that support planers during the renovation process
  of existing buildings or the planning of new buildings. Such tools should enable
  the development of consistent scenarios encompassing both the energy supply system
  and the typical behaviour of energy end-consumers. Energy suppliers on the other
  hand need tools that can take technological innovations in the building sector into
  account to determine a load and supply behaviour consistent with that of the end-consumers.
  The project aims to provide support for the optimisation of the planning process
  both of buildings and of energy supply networks within the context of the entire
  urban system. Methods The method for classification of energy end-consumer behaviour
  in an urban environment developed in project Simultan determines the spatial distribution
  of typical behaviours by means of a survey and by subsequently aggregating the findings
  according to region, residential unit and net living space area. Significant parameters
  of the various behaviour types were evaluated and compared within their urban context.
  Subsequently those parameters were analysed and their significance with regard to
  the "resident-sensitive" modelling of the energy end-consumer in urban areas was
  determined. This analysis provided the foundation for the definition of multiple
  development scenarios for the urban energy supply systems considering the potential
  of building technology. The impact of the various tariff models on the total cost
  of heat supply for single residential buildings in three categories as well as the
  resulting designs of new tariff models were tested. The requirement for support
  of an integral, simultaneous planning process of optimised building complexes resulted
  in the development of a tool for decision support on the level of a single building
  as well as on the level of a building complex. The design process was iterative
  and ran in cooperation with specialist planers in the areas of architecture, building
  physics and building services. This resulted in the design of data models and algorithms
  for comparative evaluation and analysis of technical measures for increasing the
  resiliency and efficiency of buildings while staying within the limits of pre-defined
  cost parameters. The interactive aspect of the planning process was tested within
  the context of several scenarios and optimized for efficiency and for compliance
  with the liability and warranty regulations.  One residential and one office building
  were the main use cases for evaluating the tool in regard to the design of a ventilation
  system, the display and editing of geometry, the placement of components, the calculation
  of various system parameters (e.g. U value, pressure loss, shading, thermal loads,
  etc.), as well as the translation to external data models. Results The main result
  of project Simultan is the development of a decision support system for simultaneous
  integrated multi-disciplinary planning of highly energy efficient building complexes,
  which can be utilised additionally as an analysis and fine-tuning tool for energy
  supply network planning. The simulations on an urban level generated as part of
  the project were used as the basis for the design of multiple urban energy supply
  network development scenarios. These contributed to the improved understanding of
  the urban energy landscape and, consequently, to the development of new tariff models
  serving as additional motivation for finding efficient energy solutions in building
  development. Novel metrics for detecting malware in networks and a list of corresponding
  countermeasures were devised in the area of cyber security. The resulting complex
  informational landscape is presented in a web based information visualisation tool
  that incorporates multiple levels of detail - from a single building to an entire
  urban district. Furthermore, a tool for interactive integrated planning was implemented.
  It uses the geometry as one of the main interfaces for information exchange between
  different components of the data model belonging to the various stakeholders. Neighbourhood
  relationships, aggregation, limited-by or contained-in relationships are thus automatically
  translated into data structures. The tool enables the definition of calculations
  based on component parameters, network topology, zone, building or building complex
  groups. Those can be based on elementary mathematical functions, graph evaluations
  within networks, or on complex web based simulations. The tool uses its own data
  model. It is a linked hierarchical component collection - a component can have parameters,
  calculations and sub-components and an arbitrary number of other components can
  reference each component. The tools offers an upgradable translation service that
  enables the user to define a mapping between (parts of) this internal data model
  and (parts of) external data models of varying complexity. This facilitates the
  communication with external specialized tools. An interface to an individually configurable
  GIT server allows version control and support of project data managed by multiple
  stakeholders. Prospects / Suggestions for future research The tools developed in
  the context of project Simultan have a multitude of interfaces. Their number can
  be further expanded by implementing current and future communication and data exchange
  standards - e.g. BIM. This should enable loss- and distortion-free information exchange
  with other tools, developed for various other aspects of the planning and management
  process. Another open question is the timely detection and informative display of
  conflicts (e.g. several users working on the same wall) and the support of a real-time
  expert solution by providing appropriate procedures, visualisation and management
  methods. It is one of the most significant aspects of an efficient interactive planning
  tool.  There are two follow-up projects based on the knowledge gained in project
  Simultan - one in cooperation with Flughafen Wien Schwechat and a Smart City FFG
  project. As part of those the interfaces to external tools and the usability of
  the Simultan tool are being developed further.
