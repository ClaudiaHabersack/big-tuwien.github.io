abstract: Current trends in manufacturing lead to more intelligent products, produced
  in global supply chains in shorter cycles, taking more and complex requirements
  into account. To manage this increasing complexity, cognitive decision support systems,
  building on data analytic approaches and focusing on the product life cycle, stages
  seem a promising approach. With two high-tech companies (world market leader in
  their domains) from Austria, we are approaching this challenge and jointly develop
  cognitive decision support systems for three real world industrial use cases. Within
  this position paper, we introduce our understanding of cognitive decision support
  and we introduce three industrial use cases, focusing on the requirements for cognitive
  decision support. Finally, we describe our preliminary solution approach for each
  use case and our next steps
