abstract: E-voting is the stress point of e-government regarding security  requirements.
  This paper discusses the first known distributed denial of service  attack (DDoS)
  worldwide against a legally binding remote electronic voting  channel. In particular,
  the security considerations, the topology of the attack,  and the specific countermeasures
  are described. The focus of this paper is on  analyzing the experience and providing
  lessons learned. The lessons based on  the concrete experience of this case study
  have been classified by the legal,  technical, and operational aspects for handling
  DDoS attacks against e-  government. Furthermore the relationships and interactions
  between these three  aspects are illustrated.
