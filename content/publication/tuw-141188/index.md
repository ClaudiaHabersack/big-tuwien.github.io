abstract: Model transformations are playing a vital role in the field of model engineering.
  However, for non-trivial transformation issues most approaches require imperative
  definitions, which are cumbersome and error-prone to create. Therefore, Model Transformation
  By Example (MTBE) approaches have been proposed as user-friendly alternative that
  simplifies the definition of model transformations. Up to now, MTBE approaches have
  been applied to structural models, only. In this work we apply MTBE to the domain
  of business process modeling languages, i.e., Event-driven Process Chains and UML
  activity diagrams. Compared to structural languages, business process modeling languages
  cover static semantic constraints, which are not specified in the metamodel. As
  a consequence, reasoning on the abstract syntax level is not sufficient. The contribution
  of this paper is to extend our existing MTBE approach by new alignment operators
  on the user level, which further improves the transparency of model transformation
  code. Concrete syntax and the knowledge about mapping operators are to be the only
  requisite artifacts.
