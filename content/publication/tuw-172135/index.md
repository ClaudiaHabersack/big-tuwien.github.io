abstract: Attacks on IT systems are widespread these days and pose an enormous danger
  to computer networks. For a long time, mainly servers were attacked, but these attacks
  are relatively well investigated. In the area of research honeypots and honeynets
  have been established in order to investigate this kind of attacks. Recently a new
  and generally unknown type of attacks, which pose a serious threat to IT systems
  are monitored more frequently in networks. These are so-called client-side attacks,
  which use faults in the client-software as initial point. Thereby the client computers
  are attacked by resources, which are hidden in the site that is accessed by the
  user. This is extremely malicious, as the user does not take any notice of this
  attack. Therefore a tool for the detection of client-side attacks is of extreme
  importance for the security of computer systems. Tools that are well established
  for other kind of attacks can not be used for that purpose. A possible resolution
  is provided by the newly developed method of honeyclients, which were tailored for
  the detection of client-side attacks. Therefore, honeyclients are an important factor
  in order to increase security for the users of IT systems. Honeyclients are an exciting
  new field of research with several different ways of implementation. However, a
  comparison of the efficiency and suitability of the different systems for specific
  tasks is still hardly available. This thesis contributes to a clearly arranged comparison
  of the different implementations of honeyclients. First, an introduction into the
  idea of honeyclients is given. Subsequently, it presents several implementations
  of honeyclients and evaluates them in view of their suitability for a university
  network. Finally, the gained data is analyzed in order to find out whether the theoretical
  differences that are reported for honeyclients in literature are also existing in
  practical use.
