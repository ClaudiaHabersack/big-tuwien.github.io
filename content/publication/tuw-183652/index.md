abstract: 'Abstract: In literature one can find criteria for the comparison of enterprise
  resource planning (ERP) system architectures. (Kennerley and Neely, 2002; Dumslaff,
  1994; Stefanou, 2001) However, these criteria are usually on a very detailed technical
  level and are based primarily on the requirements of larger companies. (Illa et
  al.,  2000; Verville and Halingten, 2002). It is therefore difficult for small and
  medium-size enterprises, which have other requirements, to use these criteria to
  decide upon a particular system. This paper defines a specific class of companies,
  "orchestra companies", which fall into the category of small and medium size enterprises.
  A key aspect of an orchestra company is the fact that it does not gain direct value
  from its IT systems; the IT equipment in the company is only an operating resource.
  These companies do not have their own IT departments and decisions regarding ERP
  selection are usually made by the decision makers directly without a long and expensive
  selection process. (Barbacci, 2002) On the basis of the definition and needs of
  orchestra companies, criteria for  the comparison of ERP systems specific to this
  company class have been developed. Based on a literary analysis of existing methods
  for the comparison of ERP systems, the criteria for orchestra companies are identified
  and modified. The target audiences are IT managers and decision makers who can use
  these criteria during the ERP selection process to get qualitative metrics as a
  basis for the choice of a system. The validation of the developed criteria hasBusiness
  One 2007.'
