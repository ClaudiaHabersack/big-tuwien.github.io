abstract: The exploration of the immediate surroundings through mobile location-  aware
  devices is starting to become an everyday urban activity. Due to the  increasing
  amount of available geo-referenced information, advanced  viewing and filtering
  techniques need to be investigated as a complemen-  tation to simple present-day
  2D-map presentations. This article examines  both well-established techniques (2D
  map, list view, category view) and  advanced concepts (3D map, tag cloud) regarding
  their support of mobile  urban exploration. In a field study, 26 participants used
  an experimental  multi-view prototype for viewing and filtering tasks on a route
  through an  urban environment. The results show that content-based views may provide  similarly
  good support for viewing the content as spatial interfaces.  Furthermore, the experiment
  provides evidence that the advantages of  content-based filtering techniques are
  increasingly preferred to spatial ones  in regard to the amount of available information.
