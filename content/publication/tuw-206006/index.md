abstract: This thesis deals with a comprehensive requirements analysis, design and
  implementation of an electronic management system for governmental administrations,
  which should also offer the possibility to manage and process records electronically
  ("'electronic record system"'). For this purpose, a number of different requirements
  were compiled that need to be fulfilled by such a system in order to be used successfully
  and to find acceptance among users. Such requirements may result from legal, organizational
  or other, necessities and must take the needs and views of various people working
  in different organizational units into consideration which have therefore very distinct
  challenges. These conditions were identified and analyzed during the composition
  of this work to derive and define both functional and non functional requirements.
  The implementation of these requirements in turn can be done in a variety of ways.
  For the management system implemented in this work a very process-oriented approach
  has been chosen, which allows to grasp and to analyze the inherent work processes
  of an administrative body on the one hand and to optimize those processes on the
  other hand. For this reason, the modeling of business processes holds a very high
  priority within the application. However, other essential modules - such as the
  handling of records or the administration of the application - must be considered
  as well, although these do not fit into a process-based model consistently. In the
  first step the description of the implementation focuses on the design of the architecture
  developed which provides the basis for the total system design and has been implemented
  as a three-tier model consisting of a data access layer, an application layer and
  a presentation layer. Each of these layers is subject to a detailed explanation
  individually and the various approaches in different modules are highlighted. The
  application has been implemented based on this design and therefore the concepts
  used during the implementation as well as how they fit into the overall system are
  explained next. Finally, possible extensions are presented that show how the basic
  system described in this theses could be enhanced in the future.
