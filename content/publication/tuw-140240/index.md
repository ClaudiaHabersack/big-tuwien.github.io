abstract: Due to company mergers and business to business interoperability, there
  is a need for model transformations in the area of business process modeling to
  facilitate scenarios like model integration and model synchronization. General model
  transformation approaches do not consider the special properties of business process
  models and horizontal transformation scenarios. Therefore, we propose a model transformation
  approach based on domainspecific patterns which are applied for analyzing business
  process models in a precise way. This approach facilitates the definition of business
  process model transformations, which can be easily adapted to different business
  process modeling languages and specific transformation problems. At the same time
  it supports the intuitive understanding of the domainexperts in business process
  modeling.
