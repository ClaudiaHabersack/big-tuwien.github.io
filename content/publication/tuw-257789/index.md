abstract: Mobile phones have been part of our daily use for many years, evolving from
  devices providing basic voice communication to modern smartphones, which offer a
  feature-rich, highly customizable platform as well as comprehensive connectivity
  such as in the case of Near Field Communication. This technology opens the way to
  new applications like digital wallets, electronic tickets and access control systems.
  Actual applications of these use cases may involve storage and handling of confidential
  data such as cryptographic material, authorization codes or payment-related balances,
  which are to be protected from disclosure or unauthorized modification by all means.
  Secure Elements (SEs) provide an isolated, secure environment to operate on this
  kind of sensitive information inside untrusted devices. This thesis discusses hardware
  and software-based features in modern smartphones regarding secure storage and processing
  of sensitive information on SEs. A primary focus of this work are security design
  flaws found in Secure Element Evaluation Kit (SEEK), an application framework providing
  limited access to secure elements in smartphones running the Android operating system.
  These flaws may give an attacker unrestricted access to any SE managed by SEEK.
  An exploit for one of the flaws in SEEK, running on an unmodified Android-based
  smartphone, is presented, giving a potential attacker full control of SEEK and its
  access control mechanism. The same vulnerable device is then used to perform a mobile
  payment transaction in a relay attack setup over Bluetooth and mobile networks to
  demonstrate the risks of these new technologies.
