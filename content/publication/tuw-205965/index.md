abstract: Reliable, automated classi cation of maintenance tasks based on commit messages
  is something that strongly depends on the projects and the language of the project
  sta ff. If a common language of commit messages could be derived that holds cross-project
  validity, more finely-grained and applicable analyses of maintenance activities
  in software projects could be conducted. Even on projects that do not adhere to
  commit message conventions or tool support. We propose a dictionary and a light-weight
  plug-in that yield feasible results for any software project that uses sensible
  commit messages. We evaluate our dictionary against several open-source projects
  and use software-development experts to calculate the degree of agreement between
  them and our tool. The presented tool can be used by any software development team,
  project manager or interested fellow researchers to analyze the maintenance history
  of a software project.
