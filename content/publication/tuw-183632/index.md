abstract: Fisheye views represent a promising solution to the problem of visualizing
  and interacting with large amounts of data. Such lists often require tedious scrolling,
  which can be cumbersome for users. In a controlled experiment we compared performance
  and user preferences of a fisheye list and a traditional list with a scrollbar for
  selection and drag & drop tasks. Users performed significantly better using the
  fisheye list for drag & drop tasks, whereas no significant differences were found
  with regard to selection tasks. In terms of satisfaction, users generally preferred
  the fisheye list to the standard  list. A folder view with alphabetically grouped
  items served as a baseline condition and performed best overall.
