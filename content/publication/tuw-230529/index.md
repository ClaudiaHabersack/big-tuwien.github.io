abstract: Special Issue on A Roadmap for Business Informatics:<br> In this special
  issue of the EMISA journal we include<br> seven papers, each based on a IEEE CBI<br>
  2013 keynote introducing a research domain in<br> Business Informatics. Evidently,
  these papers are<br> neither classical research papers nor pure surveys,<br> since
  they focus to a large extent on the "future",<br> i.e. the open research challenges
  (without<br> providing a solution). In the following, we define<br> the scope of
  the seven research domains and in<br> parentheses we name the author(s) who introduce(<br>
  s) the domain by a paper presented in this<br> special issue.
