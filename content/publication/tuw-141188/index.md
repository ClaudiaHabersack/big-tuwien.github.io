abstract: Model transformations are playing a vital role in the field of model engineering.
  However, for non-trivial transformation issues most approaches require imperative
  definitions, which are cumbersome and<br> error-prone to create. Therefore, Model
  Transformation By Example<br> (MTBE) approaches have been proposed as user-friendly
  alternative that<br> simplifies the definition of model transformations. Up to now,
  MTBE approaches have been applied to structural models, only. In this work we apply
  MTBE to the domain of business process modeling languages, i.e., Event-driven Process
  Chains and UML activity diagrams. Compared to structural languages, business process
  modeling languages cover static semantic constraints, which are not specified in
  the metamodel. As a consequence, reasoning on the abstract syntax level is not sufficient.
  The contribution of this paper is to extend our existing MTBE approach by new alignment
  operators on the user level, which further improves the transparency of model transformation
  code. Concrete syntax and the knowledge about mapping operators are to be the only
  requisite artifacts.
