abstract: This paper describes the work effort to update the "Organizational Project
  Management Maturity Model" (OPM3) and publish the second edition of the OPM3 organizational
  maturity standard. We provide a brief background on the field project management
  maturity models, and then focus on describing the details of the OPM3 2nd Edition
  update project, including insights on the projectÂ´s goals, how it was organized
  and how volunteers contributed. We provide feedback to the project management community
  on the update of a significant organizational maturity standard and note the challenges
  encountered during the work effort in a large and distributed project staffed by
  volunteers. Finally we discuss the lessons learned, and reflect on the experience
  as a whole.
