abstract: Inter-organizational systems span from business models over business process
  models to their execution on top of a service-oriented architecture. In our project
  BSopt we have developed an integrated model-driven approach that addresses the different
  layers and builds up-on well-estabilshed languages on each of these layers. When
  applying our integrated methodology we recognized that models for the same business
  case are similar, but still varying for different business partner networks. Accordingly,
  a systematic approach to derive a model from another model, i.e., from a reference
  model, is needed. Significant achievements have been made by the reference modeling
  community in finding ways to leverage the potentials of model reuse in business
  process modeling. In this paper we outline the potentials of adapting design techniques
  known from reference modeling to the specific needs of inter-organizational system
  develpment even if we do not provide a solution yet.
