abstract: Many medical areas such as diagnose, treatment and patient care benefited
  from the application of IT-infrastructure ranging from complex architectures to
  small monitoring devices providing better access to information, more efficient
  data exchange and increased data processing. The goal of this thesis is to bring
  these benefits to the field of emergency care. Triage is a process during emergency
  care which aims at maximizing the provided care in a situation where the available
  resources are limited by diagnosing injuries and categorizing patients into groups
  to determine the priority for treatment and transport. Our intent is to increase
  the quality and amount of medical care for patients in such situations by introducing
  electronic Triage Tags to increase the efficiency of the entire tri-age process.
  Hence, this thesis evaluates the core requirements and deduces a framework for an
  electronic Triage Tag, utilizing RFID tags and a client/server approach based on
  wireless communication. Information gathering is performed by the mobile triage
  devices with integrated RFID reader. Finally, the thesis presents a simple proof
  of concept application.
