abstract: In this paper we present a longitudinal study comparing an alphabetical
  selection keyboard to a multi-tap selection keyboard using a game controller as
  input device. Our experiment showed the alphabetic selection keyboard to be faster
  for novice (7.72 wpm vs. 6.34 wpm) and expert users (11.87 wpm vs. 9.64 wpm). The
  multi-tap selection keyboard was more error prone than the alphabetic selection
  keyboard. Qualitative results showed that over time the alphabetic selection keyboard
  was preferred by the users.
