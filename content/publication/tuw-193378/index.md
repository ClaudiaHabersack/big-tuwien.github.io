abstract: This work presents an experience report on the  integration testing of a
  secured SOA with many independent  service providers in the &#64257;eld of eHealth.
  The services itself are  closed-source to the integrators and so the veri&#64257;cation
  is message-  based only. Due to strict security requirements, all services  are
  limited to use SSL-encrypted connections. This makes it  challenging to consume
  the messages even during testing and  therefor to verify the correct behavieour
  of each service. Three  strategies are presented, each showing different bene&#64257;ts
  and  drawbacks to the integration testing process. In this report  one most applicable
  approach was further implemented and  discussed.
