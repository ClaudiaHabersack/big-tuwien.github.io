abstract: Robustness of applications used for Voice  over Internet Protocol based
  systems against attacks  is a critical part to secure such systems. Automatic  security
  testing is required to detect security vulnera-  bilities in an ef&#64257;cient
  way. This enables to harden the  applications early during the development phase.
  In the  paper we present a fuzzer framework to detect security  vulnerabilities
  in Voice over IP (VoIP) Softphones which  implement Session Initiation Protocol
  (SIP). The pre-  sented approach automates the Graphical User Interface  (GUI) interaction
  for softphones during fuzzing and  also observes the behavior of the softphone GUIs
  to  automatically detect application errors. Results of testing  two open source
  softphones by using our fuzzer showed  that various unknown vulnerabilities could
  be identi&#64257;ed  with the implemented fuzzer and some vulnerabilities  were
  found that are only detectable by using GUI  observation.
