abstract: Ever faster changing market conditions require businesses to frequently<br>
  adapt their business processes and the underlying workflow systems. Serviceoriented<br>
  architectures are said to deliver this flexibility by loose coupling. In this<br>
  chapter we provide a survey on realizing flexible workflows on top of service oriented<br>
  architectures.We show how orchestrations and choreographies may be implemented<br>
  by state-of-the-art web services technology. The role of agents in realizing<br>
  workflows among services is discussed. Furthermore, we discuss service provision<br>
  in dynamic environments, when partners are dynamically bound to the workflow<br>
  and when changes to the workflow schema happen.
