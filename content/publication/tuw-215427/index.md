abstract: We developed a mobile ward round system based on openEHR for the use on
  smartphones and tablet computers using the Android platform which integrates and
  uses NFC to explore new ways of computer interaction, data processing and workflows
  in the medical world. Based on the automatic patient identification via NFC using
  the mobile device, physicians can easily view recent ward round results and edit/add
  information without manually selecting the patient from a list. The application
  mainly shows new ideas and possibilities to improve medical workflows and usability
  and how mobile devices can make use of existing frameworks and backend services.
  Relying on the openEHR standard, physicians are not limited to a certain ward round
  document anymore but can define their own ward round templates by means of the openEHR
  templates and archetypes.
