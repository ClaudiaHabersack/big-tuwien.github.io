abstract: The fast evolution of the internet has tremendously increased the variety
  of modern communication possibilities for people, offering new sources for social
  contacts via communities and networks. Likewise, there exists a steadily increasing
  demand for social e-commerce, an emerging phenomenon also called social shopping.
  Especially applicable for B2C and C2C e-commerce, social shopping is currently characterized
  by offering platforms where consumers collaborate online, get advice from trusted
  individuals, find the right products of a repository and finally purchase them.
  This paper illustrates an integrated framework for social shopping as basis for
  a new prototype system. For the design of the framework, conventional community
  and shopping systems as well as existing best practice social commerce models were
  analyzed in detail. The presented results highlight core entities, functions and
  interactions of the social shopping concept, summarized in a concise diagram.
