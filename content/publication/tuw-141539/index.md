abstract: Workout diagnostics is a substantial component in the process of enhancing
  athletic performance. Capturing workout diagnostic data is a wide-ranging process
  that has been undergoing constant advancement in recent years. Along with the evolution
  of the Internet, applications in this field have been made available, that especially
  promote and support the quality and possibilities of communication between athletes
  and their trainers. This study aims designing a defined process to capture workout
  diagnostic data by using computer-based methods, thus improving and simplifying
  the communication between athletes and their trainers. This goal requires a theoretical
  analysis of this special field as a basis for the development of a new system for
  the definition, capture and transmission of relevant data. To demonstrate the technological
  feasibility of the elaborated concept, a prototype of the presented system was implemented.
  The new ideas introduced in the present study are intended to demonstrate applications
  of information technology in sports, and simultaneously  to push their realization.  The
  concrete conception and implementation of the system is achieved through the analysis
  and the development of the three process sections of definition, capture and transmission.
  The process segment of definition deals with the design and development of a data
  structure that represents the data required by the trainer and/or by athletes. This
  structure provides a basis for capturing and exchanging reference data between the
  people involved. By means of the dynamic generation of user interfaces, the process
  segment of capture is capable to capture and modify entry data independently from
  the processing system by using the established data structure. This data structure
  as well as the captured reference data are subsequently exchanged between the people
  participating in the workout process, in the process segment of transmission. For
  transmission, the instant messaging technology, specifically Jabber, serves as basis
  for the communications platform. The elaboration of a prototype using the design
  approaches presented clearly shows the feasibility of the system designed in this
  study. Finally, future advancements as well as further possible applications for
  workout diagnostic data capture are discussed.
