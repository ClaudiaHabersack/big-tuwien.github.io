### Topic

InteGra 4.0 focuses on the horizontal integration throughout value chains as well as on the vertical integration of networked production systems as identified by the German working committee for Industrie 4.0. Thereby, we build up from (i) the ISA-95 industry standard (ANSI/ISA-95; DIN EN 62264) to describe the vertical integration between ERP- and MES-systems as well as from (ii) the REA (Resource-Event-Agent) business ontology (ISO 15944-4) for the modeling of value creation networks between different companies, i.e., the horizontal integration. This exploratory project envisions the merging of concepts and models of ISA-95 and REA and to evaluate its benefit for a universal model-driven system engineering approach throughout the entire value chain. InteGra 4.0 will involve production companies of the steel industry as well as software companies in order to accomodate different views on the research topic and to get a better understanding of open demands on vertical and horizontal integration in these domains.
