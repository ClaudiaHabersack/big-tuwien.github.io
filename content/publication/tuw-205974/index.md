abstract: Social networks like Facebook, Xing or LinkedIn support people previously
  unknown to each other in getting connected based on their shared interests. But
  a common platform that would allow them to additionally find each other, get connected
  and exchange information according to their shared tasks does not exist yet. The
  paper strives to define and specify such a platform that extends the current networks
  and introduces the term "Global Joint Artifacts" (GJA). In software development
  in/complete work packages and project pieces are often called "artifacts". As such
  Global Joint Artifacts are globally distributed, but connected and dependant artifacts.
  Apart from the general concept the platform to be designed is also named "Global
  Joint Artifacts". First a theoretical study was conducted to identify the current
  trends, the state of the art and the technological possibilities. The paper focuses
  the outsourced software test, where people get connected with their artifacts, and
  artifacts are interconnected with each other. It should be possible to use GJA to
  manage the work packages, software development artifacts, defects and generally
  the knowledge in a project. A proof of concept prototype was implemented for the
  practical application of the theoretical findings. Its purpose is to show that the
  value of originally independent information is increased by connections. So even
  users at remote locations can participate in knowledge exchange and knowledge distribution.
  The result of the paper is the comparison of the GJA prototype to existing software
  systems, which are used for software development and test. This proved clearly that
  through its connections GJA allows quick access to similar information and allows
  to find the carriers of knowledge. Together with saving time and money the information's
  value is increased, redundancies can be avoided and synergies can be exploited.
