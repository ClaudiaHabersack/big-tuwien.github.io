abstract: 'Software testing is an essential activity in any software engineering project.
  In line with the increasing expectations regarding the quality of the tested products,
  also the challenges for test experts rise due to accelerated development cycles,
  a rapid technological progress and because of the distributed nature of modern information
  technology (IT) systems. While manual testing continues to play a substantial role
  in the testing process, more and more attention is paid to automated software testing.
  This work reflects this development and examines basic concepts and important needs
  for an automation framework for functional software testing with respect to the
  increasing scale, heterogeneity and intricacy of modern IT systems. Some problems
  arise out of this complexity. What are the key demands with a focus on black box
  testing and automated test execution on the system level? What are the requirements
  and basic concepts for such a testing framework that enables even technically less
  experienced staff to benefit from high levels of test automation? What are the developer''s
  needs regarding extensibility or flexibility of such a framework if we consider
  the ongoing evolution in today''s IT systems? This master thesis provides answers
  to these questions. The requirements elicitation was a multistep approach. Initially,
  a research for appropriate literature was performed. Based on this analysis, qualitative
  interviews were conducted with experts who are experienced in the development of
  comparable frameworks. The elicitation was completed with a brief examination of
  existing solutions. Afterwards, the findings and the created catalog were subject
  to an evaluation procedure with two presentations and a review by further experts
  in the field. Essentially, the outcome of the work is divided into two main parts.
  The first part is an explanation of the basic concepts that have to be considered
  in the development of such a framework. This includes, for example, six fundamental
  design principles for a functional test automation framework and a suitable definition
  of the term framework. Exemplary test scenarios and design sketches for the framework
  are also outlined within this section. The second part, the actual core of the result,
  is a comprehensive catalog with more than five hundred requirements. These requirements
  are sorted into eight major categories: Abstraction of Test Objects, Test Specification,
  Element Interaction, Element Identification, Execution Control, Test Results, Utilities
  for Automation and Miscellaneous Requirements. All categories and their 29 subcategories
  are explained within this thesis. Thus, this work provides a unique academic compendium
  of appropriate concepts and concrete requirements for a corresponding test automation
  framework.'
