abstract: Shorter life cycles of products and services require faster changing business
  models. Information systems must quickly adjust to the adapted business models.
  Business models are usually described by their own proprietary notation, which is
  incompatible with UML - the de-facto modeling standard in software engineering.
  In order to allow a straight-through modeling approach from business models over
  business process models to software artifacts, it is desirable to use a common modeling
  approach. Thus, we suggest to map existing concepts to describe business models
  onto the UML notation. In our work we mainly focus on inter-organizational systems.
  A promising approach describing a business model for an inter-organizational network
  of actors is delivered by e3-Value. In this paper, we present a discussion of different
  approaches to represent the e3-Value concepts by means of UML. A UML notation for
  e3-Value is a precondition to future work on aligning e3-Value to UML-based approaches
  specifying inter-organizational business processes.
