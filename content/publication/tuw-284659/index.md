abstract: In this paper we introduce Hyper Typer, a serious Android game for collecting
  text entry performance data on a large scale in an unsupervised manner. Publishing
  the game on the Google Play Store resulted in a total of 1,917 usable transcribed
  phrases with 58,829 keystrokes over an eleven-week period. By analyzing the data,
  we demonstrate the feasibility of the method and give preliminary results regarding
  the overall performance and error rate of players. Moreover, the collected data
  allows us to compare two of the most commonly used Android soft-keyboards.
