abstract: Wrist injuries are a common and frequent health issue requiring rehabilitation.
  Occupational and physical therapists create individual exercises for their patients,
  which include both ambulatory/stationary and home exercises. Practice and literature
  show, however, that autonomously performed exercises are likely not carried out
  accurately and may endanger progress of rehabilitation. We propose the design of
  WristDroid - an Android-based serious game to leverage execution of home exercises
  and deliver enjoyable therapeutic progress in a motivational environment that patients
  can thrive on. Two occupational and eight physical therapists were interviewed to
  identify requirements for such an application and aided in refinement of various
  prototypes. Preliminary evaluation results by physical therapists suggest that WristDroid
  supports wrist rehabilitation and offers a motivating and empowering way to recover
  from wrist injuries.
