abstract: Business documents directly exchanged between applications usually follow
  a certain business document standard. No matter whether these standards are traditional
  EDI standards or XML-based, they are very generic including all elements that may
  be of need to any company in this world. Before being used in a partnership, a subset
  of these elements has to be defined based on the business context (geopolitical
  region, industry, etc.). Usually the definition of these subsets-called Message
  Implementation Guidelines-starts from scratch, and, thus, is very time-consuming.
  In this paper we present an approach to explicitly assign context to the definition
  of Message Implementation Guidelines. This contextual information is also used to
  calculate a subset for to-be-developed Message Implementation Guidelines based on
  existing ones. The corresponding approach is supported by a prototype implementation.
