abstract: Voice over Internet Protocol based systems replace phone lines in many scenarios
  and are in wide use today. Automated security tests of such systems are required
  to detect implementation and configuration mistakes early and in an efficient way.
  In this paper we present a plugin for our fuzzer framework fuzzolution to automatically
  detect security vulnerabilities in Session Initiation Protocol based Voice over
  Internet Protocol softphones, which are examples for endpoints in such telephone
  systems. The presented approach automates the interaction with the Graphical User
  Interface of the softphones during test execution and also observes the behavior
  of the softphones using multiple metrics. Results of testing two open source softphones
  by using our fuzzer showed that various unknown vulnerabilities could be identified
  with the implemented plugin for our fuzzing framework.
