abstract: Not least due to the widespread use of meta modeling concepts, model transformation
  techniques have reached<br> a certain level of maturity (Czarnecki and Helsen, 2006).
  Nevertheless, defining transformations in some<br> application areas in our case
  business process modeling is still a challenge because current transformation<br>
  languages provide general solutions but do not support issues specific to a distinct
  area. We aim at providing<br> generic solutions for model transformation problems
  distinct to the area of horizontal business process model<br> transformations. As
  a first step in this endeavor, this work reports on the most pressing problems encountered<br>
  at defining business process model transformations.
