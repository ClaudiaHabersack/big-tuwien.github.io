  # WARNING: A person's courses and publications will only be fetched if included on this whitelist.
  #          In some cases it may be necessary to whitelist people that are not members of the BIG TISS research unit
  #          in order to fetch their publications. Records like that will not have a profile page created or courses
  #          fetched, but publications will be loaded as intended.

  # The publication database does not necessarily use the same names as TISS.
  # In order to link names with the user profiles, names must be transformed to the correct name identifier
  # Example:
  #   transform:
  #     Maximilian Mustermann: Max Mustermann
  #     M. Mustermann: Max Mustermann
  # This setup will map all names matching either "Maximilian Mustermann" or "M. Mustermann" to "Max Mustermann"
  # WARNING: ALL NAMES THAT CONTAIN NON ASCII LETTERS MUST PROVIDE TRANSFORM RECORDS REMOVING THEM
