abstract: This report describes the challenges and experiences with the incremental
  migration of a BPEL to a BPMN 2.0 process engine. The transition is motivated by
  a strategic reorientation towards the new standard as well as end of life of the
  previous product. The solution reflects the preliminary steps of integrating the
  new platform into the existing application and support for parallel operation. This
  paper further describes the incrementally executed reverse engineering of process
  definitions and migration of instances by applying four different, tiered strategies
  in an economically viable way. The report concludes by detailing the lessons learned
  to provide additional guidance for attempts to apply the detailed approach.
