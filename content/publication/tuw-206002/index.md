abstract: The current economic situation is putting particularly the financial industry
  under pressure. In the face of shrinking markets, costs must be cut and the efficient
  use of resources must be ensured. Thereby, the main focus is put on the role of
  IT, as this area is closely linked to business processes and represents a major
  cost factor. IT governance enables an effective alignment of IT to the business
  strategy. The core functions of IT governance are the generation of enterprise value
  as well as the management of IT risks. In this context, Cobit, representing IT governance
  frameworks, provides assessment methods and maturity models to assess the efficiency
  of control practices. The thesis aims at illustrating the applicability of Cobit
  in the banking field. The main focus is thereby put on the process of service cost
  allocation. The aim is to assess the efficiency of the applied control practices.
  For this purpose, a procedure model is designed and applied to a case study. The
  company used for the analysis is an Austrian financial service provider headquartered
  in Vienna. As a result of the analysis, the efficacy of the existing control practices
  can be estimated. Consequently, a risk assessment is drawn up and the degree of
  implementation of the control practices defined by Cobit is evaluated. Based on
  the risk analysis, potential improvement measures shall be identified. In conclusion,
  the application of IT governance frameworks, in particular of Cobit, will be demonstrated.
  The approach will show, if the outcome and performance measurements, defined by
  Cobit, are universally applicable and support the continuous planning and conducting
  of audits.
