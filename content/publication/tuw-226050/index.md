abstract: Nowadays a few concepts of games and game design are used in different non-entertainment
  domains (this is also called gamification). Part of this gamification is also emerging
  in the health sector. This work-in-progress paper tries to define a methodology
  and an architecture how an achievement based service in healthcare can be designed,
  analyzed and implemented. This service uses patient data from different sources
  (e.g., from a patient´s personal health record) to share anonymized health related
  information/achievements with other people. Thus, it might build up a comparative
  behavior between patients and motivate them to increase the usage of a personal
  health record.
