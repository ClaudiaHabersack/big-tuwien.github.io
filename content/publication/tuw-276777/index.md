abstract: Nowadays, manufacturers are increasingly able to collect and analyze data
  from sensors on manufacturing equipment, and also from other types of machinery,
  such as smart meters, pipelines, delivery trucks, etc. Nevertheless, many manufacturers
  are not yet ready to use analytics beyond a tool to track historical performance.
  However, just knowing what happened and why it happened does not use the full potential
  of the data and is not sufficient anymore. Manufacturers need to know what happens
  next and what actions to take in order to get optimal results. It is a challenge
  to develop advanced analytics techniques including machine learning and predictive
  algorithms to transform data into relevant information for gaining useful insights
  to take appropriate action. In the proposed research we target new analytic methods
  and tools that make insights not only more understandable but also actionable by
  decision makers. The latter requires that the results of data analytics have an
  immediate effect on the processes of the manufacturer. Thereby, data analytics has
  the potential to improve industrial processes by reducing maintenance costs, avoiding
  equipment failures and improving business operations. Accordingly, the overall objective
  of this project is to develop a set of tools - including algorithms, analytic machinery,
  planning approaches and visualizations - for industrial process improvements based
  on data analytics.
