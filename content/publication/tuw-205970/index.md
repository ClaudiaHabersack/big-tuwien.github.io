abstract: The transition from Web 2.0 into the Semantic Web represents the currently
  ongoing step in the evolution of the World Wide Web and the consideration of semantics
  in information processing gets more important. This master thesis discusses the
  foundations of the Semantic Web and describes the latest scientific research activities
  in the area of document management. The practical part of this work contains the
  design and prototyping of a semantic web-based document management system for the
  organisational units "Organisation und Koordination" and "Gebäude und Technik" of
  the Vienna University of Technology. Specifically, this work illustrates the use
  of semantic technologies to improve document management in a real business scenario.
  The processing of information is based on the knowledge and context of the application
  domain. The result is a collaborative tagging system for documents that assists
  its users by providing semantically meaningful recommendations of tags for categorization
  and navigation.
