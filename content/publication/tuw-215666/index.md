abstract: Despite all progress on the scientific foundations of information system
  security, human factor attacks are still not sufficiently researched. This is mostly
  due to the focus to build sufficient security against social engineering attacks
  based on personnel security measures. Modern information security models rely on
  multi- dimensional approaches. Countering social engineering attacks more affectively
  would also demand a multidimensional approach to information security. Such an approach
  implies an interconnection of the technical, human and organizational domains and
  the relationship with corporate governance. This paper proposes ITIL to be such
  a framework against hackers using social engineering techniques. Based on an exemplified
  described process of a medium sized financial institution, security mechanisms are
  identified and classified in the ITIL framework, and their effectiveness against
  social engineering attacks is discussed. After evaluating security measures according
  to ITIL for their potential to serve as such a multidimensional counter measure,
  ITIL measures will be classified according to their application area in preventing
  or counter acting attacks, thus providing a management catalogue of security measures
  against social engineering attacks. Finally it is shown that ITIL as a framework
  against hackers using social engineering techniques can be integrated into enterprise
  wide information security governance.
