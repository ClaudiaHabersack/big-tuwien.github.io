abstract: This diploma thesis explores the applicability and usability of fisheye
  view lists for visualizing large amounts of information within limited screen space.
  Fisheye views provide a balance between the global overview of large data structures
  and local detail within these structures. Therefore fisheye views allow the visualization
  of large amounts of data on a single screen without scrollbars, providing the user
  with the necessary details to interact efficiently with the data on screen without
  sacrificing the representation of the global context the user is operating in. The
  goal of this diploma thesis was to evaluate the usability of fisheye view lists
  for use in desktop user interfaces. Usability tests were conducted to evaluate the
  usability and user acceptance of fisheye view lists in comparison to lists with
  scrollbars and treeviews. This document presents origin and basic concepts of fisheye
  views and continues with an overview of related work and prior research in this
  area. Consequently the implementation of a fisheye view list as part of this thesis
  and the method employed in the usability tests is described. Finally the usability
  test results are presented and discussed.
