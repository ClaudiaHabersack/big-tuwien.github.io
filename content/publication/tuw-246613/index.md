abstract: Due to the changes brought by the Bologna Process we observe a large demand
  for new inform- ation systems supporting the academic processes. The software demanded
  is not available on the market. We observe large projects in pioneer universities.
  Because universities have little experi - ence in implementing and operating such
  systems, it seems to be worth while to examine the es- sentials of organizational
  information systems. We reflect on essentials of organizational inform- ation systems
  and derive normative advise for colleagues. After Lehman's definition of embed-
  ded systems 35 years ago, we look at very complex systems, embedded into large organizations.
  The complexity of such system's software stems from its database, created by the
  organization's users. We argue, which functions are part of a campus management
  system's core (CMS) and which are not. E. g. 'E-learning' or 'library' do not belong
  to it, but need secure and efficient in- terfaces. Because CMS are expensive they
  should be implemented into an organization evolu- tionary. We show examples of two
  cases and provide an overview of a reference model of the database's core.
