abstract: Exchanging structured business documents is inevitable for successful collaboration
  in electronic commerce. A prerequisite, for fostering the interoperability between
  business partners utilizing different business document standards, is a mapping
  between different standards. However, the effort involved in creating those mappings
  is hard to estimate. For example, the complexity of standardized formats is one
  crucial aspect affecting the effort of the mapping process. Therefore, a notion
  of complexity is desirable for both, manual as well as automatic mapping processes.
  For this reason we develop an initial set of metrics, based on well established
  metrics for XML Schema, allowing to analyze the complexity of business document
  standards. Having such metrics at hand allows estimating the complexity and hence
  the mapping effort of a business document standard, prior to the actual mapping
  process. We demonstrate the complexity metrics on three different business document
  standards from the electronic commerce domain.
