Since July, 2012 I have been involved as a researcher in the BIG team at the Vienna University of Technology. My current work is concerned with model-driven techniques and their use in the evolution or modernization of legacy software towards cloud-based software. Before that, I was researcher and lecturer at the University of Vienna. I received my masterâ€™s degree after studying computer science at the Johannes Kepler University Linz in 2008.
