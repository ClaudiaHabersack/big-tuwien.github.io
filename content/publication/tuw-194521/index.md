abstract: This master thesis deals with the application of genetic algorithms within  the
  frameworks of trading tools. Genetic algorithms are stochastic optimi-  zation techniques
  developed by John H. Holland. There is a recent develop-  ment in investment &#64257;nance
  to integrate genetic algorithms in trading tools  to maximize pro&#64257;ts. The
  goal of this thesis is to describe the principles of  genetic algorithms and to
  show the technical and strategic advantages of  using genetic algorithms in trading
  tools. Two trading tools -  "Merchant of  Venice" and  "MultiCharts" - have been
  chosen for this purpose. They will  be examined and compared in regards to common
  characteristics such as  features, license details, costs and system requirements.
  Merchant of Venice  uses genetic algorithms for input parameter optimization and
  buy/sell rules  generation. MultiCharts uses genetic algorithms for input parameter
  optimi-  zation and portfolio optimization. Empirical experiments and analysis with  di&#64256;erent
  parameters will be conducted to evaluate the performance of the  application of
  genetic algorithms in trading tools. The performance of ge-  netic algorithms in
  di&#64256;erent economical market conditions, such as growing  and instable markets
  is speci&#64257;cally evaluated. The results indicate signi&#64257;cant  potentials
  of the application of genetic algorithms within the frameworks of  trading tools.
