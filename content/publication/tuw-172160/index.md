abstract: 'The main objective of this project is to create a software error classification
  matrix by using an empirical qualitative study. This software error catalogue is
  aimed at supporting software tester teams in detecting errors on the point of observation
  and classifying them into three different categories: textual description, bug tracking
  with the help of a screenshot, and recording the errors per video. The method using
  black box tests (tracking bugs on the user interface) comes to the fore. This thesis
  will focus primarily upon usability errors in addition to functionality errors;
  such errors were grouped and abstracted to generic terms within predefined categories
  and served to create the concrete content of the software error catalogue. A special
  online tool was programmed in respect of the requirements of the qualitative study.
  30 selected experts in the field of software security were asked to classify 5 errors
  into the 3 specified categories. During the interview valuable information was collected
  in regard to the actions and reactions of the test persons, as well as the system
  itself. The responses were very detailed due to the open character of the questions;
  possible an-swers were not given. The data reflects the personal experience made
  by the experts in the past. The results of this study confirm the proposed hypothesis
  by fifty percent. In summary the data evaluation as well as the subsequent data
  analysis reflects the sur-vey of the fundamental hypothesis in regard of usability
  errors and functionality errors. In conclusion, two main groups can be determined:
  "layout" and "dynamic behaviour". Errors, which are in connection with the "layout"
  of a website, are mostly assigned to the set of usability. The second field, "dynamic
  response" and behaviour are linked to functionality errors. In consequence of the
  collected data an error classification cata-logue was designed, which can serve
  and assist as a model matrix for software tester teams.'
