abstract: In business-to-business e-commerce, traditional electronic data interchange
  (EDI) approaches such as UN/EDIFACT have been superseded by approaches like web
  services and ebXML. Nevertheless, a precise and common semantic definition of business
  documents exchanged is needed. In order to become independent from a transfer syntax,
  we prefer defining the documents as platform independent models. An approach that
  follows this idea is the UN/CEFACT's core component standard. Core components are
  reusable semantic building blocks which can be combined in various ways to create
  shared libraries of interoperable business documents. In order to use standard UML
  modeling tools we have developed a UML profile for the core components standard.
  Furthermore, we adapt the UN/CEFACT naming and design rules for the UML profile
  in order to derive XML schemas for business document exchanges. The overall approach
  is demonstrated by using a specific example from the field of eCommerce.
