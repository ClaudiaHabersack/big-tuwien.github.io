abstract: 'Traditional Balinese architecture is based on ancient Bali-Hindu philosophy
  which can be observed in traditional built environments on Bali. The underlying
  architectural principles are very complex containing intrinsic "parametric rules"
  based on both a philosophical and a building tradition. The parameters are in relation
  to the religious belief system as well as being derived from the bodily dimensions
  of the "head" of a building. We aim at determining in which way these underlying
  building principles can be preserved by contemporary digital means. As a hypothesis
  we test a parametric formalization as CGA shape grammar made operative using the
  CityEngine. In order to formalize these building principles the following methods
  were devised: identification and collection of appropriate literature in English
  and Indonesian, partial translation of available material to English, field trips
  for contextual information and additional knowledge, and transformation of all sources
  of information into a shape grammar. An interactive visualization of ancient Balinese
  building principles is exemplified through the traditional house compound, the "rumah",
  demonstrating the strength of a parametric approach. Moreover, it includes both,
  tangible and intangible heritage aspects by analyzing the appearance of (tangible)
  built heritage, as well as the (intangible) underlying philosophy and traditional
  knowledge. Our contribution aims at supporting the understanding and preservation
  of the architectural heritage of Balinese building principles.'
