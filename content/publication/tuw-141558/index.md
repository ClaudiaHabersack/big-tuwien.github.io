abstract: Code reviews are powerful methods to reveal defects in program code, during
  the various phases of the software development process. As important reviews are
  for the quality of a product, as cost-intensive they are. For that reason the optimization
  of the review process becomes more and more important. Reports from various companies
  document deficits in implementing and executing time-consuming and documentation-centric
  review processes. This work specially goes into detail with problems caused by insufficient
  planning, nonexisting standardisation, managing data, creating reports and analyzing
  the review process. To reduce deficits and increase efficiency in the review process,
  this work presents a concept for a code review module. The objective of this concept
  is to support a specific role-based review process in integrated development environments.
  By using helpful tools, provided by integrated development environments, and a specific
  role-based review process, based on the IEEE standard 1028-1997 for software reviews,
  this module should help to reduce the identified deficits and make reviews more
  effective. Additionally, this concept supports automatically creating review documents
  as well as analyzing the review process. Based on the concept, this work presents
  a prototypical implementation of a code review module. The tool implements all requirements
  specified in the concept as a plug-in module for the popular Eclipse platform. Results
  from early evaluations during implementation indicated potential increase in efficiency.
  Furthermore, empirical studies will be conducted to find out the real dimension
  of increase and to improve the handling of the plug-in module.
