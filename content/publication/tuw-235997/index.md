abstract: Navigation in long forms commonly employs user interface design patterns
  such as scrolling, tabs, and wizard steps. Since these patterns hide contextual
  form fields outside the viewport or behind other tabs or pages, we propose to apply
  the focus+context principle from information visualization to form design. This
  work presents a design space analysis to support usability engineering of focus+context
  form naviga- tion. We evaluated the design spaceÂ´s usefulness and applica- bility
  in a case study and found the design space has fostered creativity and helped to
  clearly document design decisions, indicating it can be a valuable support for engineering
  intelli- gent, form-based user interfaces.
