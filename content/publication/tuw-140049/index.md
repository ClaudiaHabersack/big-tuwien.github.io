abstract: UN/CEFACTÂ´s modeling methodology (UMM) is used to develop global choreographies
  of inter-organizational business processes. UMM models should be publically available
  in order to foster re-use and to reference them in trading partner agreements. In
  this paper we define a mapping of UMM models or parts thereof to the ebXML registry
  information model (RIM).
