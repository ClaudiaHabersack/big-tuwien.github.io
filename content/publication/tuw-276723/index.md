abstract: Matchmaking and cooperation are interactions widely available within internet-based
  platforms. However, to start using such functionality, one must first become a member
  of the platform. In an effort to push matchmaking and cooperation into the protocol
  stack of the Web, we demonstrate how an existing taxi service is integrated with
  a decentralized Web based infrastructure, the Web of Needs (WoN), using a chatbot
  that can be programmed declaratively to enter into certain types of agreements with
  users. The bot mediates between an existing Web service and users of the RDF-based
  WoN network.
