abstract: This thesis aims to provide additional insight into the effect of different
  development strategies on the maintainability of code. Maintainability is defined
  as the ease with which a software can be modified. Throughout a software development
  project a lot of time is spent on maintenance. Therefore code that is easy to maintain
  is desireable. To be able to detect differences between development strategies a
  case study with a development team of an Austrian company was conducted. The team
  changed its development strategy from the waterfall model to Scrum. The waterfall
  model is a sequential development process with emphasis on documentation. Scrum
  is an agile, iterative development process. The development of the code maintainability
  was analyzed when using the waterfall model and when using Scrum as development
  strategy. In order to quantifiy the maintainability of code the common approach
  of using static code analysis is used. Based on results in literature a set of software
  metrics was used to assess the code maintainbility. The statistical method used
  for validation is a non-parametric analysis of variance (Friedman's ANOVA) with
  post-hoc tests. The results indicate that Scrum does not decrease the code maintainability
  as much as the waterfall model over time. Scrum does a better job in preserving
  the level of code maintainability than the waterfall model. The possible reasons
  for this are discussed in the thesis.
