abstract: This work challenges the fast and dynamic movement of new technologies in
  developing countries like Mozambique and places itself in the research field of
  ICT4D. The research was carried out as part of the ICT4DMZ1 project. The aim of
  this work is to empower people in developing countries through the means of technology
  and enable social progress in Mozambique. To do so, local engineering experts who
  better understand the country´s challenges are key to success. This work analyses
  the current technological constraints of mobile phones in Mozambique to further
  enable ICT4D projects. Since the ubiquitous technology; mobile phones can be found
  everywhere, it was used as the prime device in this study. In the past, several
  researcher underlined the potential of this technology. Mobile phones are easily
  accessible and are readily available in Mozambique.
