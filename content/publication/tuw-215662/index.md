abstract: This thesis presents the design and the empiric evaluation of a virtual
  keyboard requiring 50% less space than an equivalent state-of-the-art solution.
  The introduced keyboard has an ambiguous button configuration that allows the selection
  of a "secondary" character with a simultaneous second touch. There is numerous related
  work in the literature but none that combines single and mulitouch for text input.
  The prototype of the new keyboard was compared to a default qwerty keyboard in a
  within-subject evaluation. The five participants were instructed to single-handedly
  transcribe text in 10 sessions, where in every session the participants spent 10
  minutes on each keyboard. The introduced keyboard displayed a significant learning
  curve with a peak performance of 17.4 words-per-minute, which is equivalent to approximately
  60 % of the default solution which produced a maximum of 29.4 wpm in the evaluation.
  It was concluded that the investigated space-saving input concept proofs to be working,
  but fails to outperform the established technology.
