abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are nowadays adapted to the company-specific
  requirements by customization. Whereas smaller and general feature changes are performed
  quickly by parameterization, changes of a company's business activities may lead
  to enormous changes in the system's code. To overcome this problem, we introduce
  an approach of a flexible ERP system which can be adapted by specific business models
  for each individual company/tenant by using model engineering techniques. Our approach
  REAlist is built on top of a generic data structure based on the Resource Event
  Agent (REA) business modeling ontology and provided as a cloud based service. Business
  models for each company are described by a domain specific language called the REA-DSL.
  REAlist enables companies to incorporate business activity changes quickly and without
  extensive code changes.
