abstract: Resource conservation has become a pressing issue around the world. Therefore
  it is necessary to create an increased awareness. Besides the prominent topic of
  energyconservation the conservation of water is still often neglected. Yet, there
  exist many opportunities to conserve it In order to address this issue the present
  research deals with the daily water consumption in the shower. Since feedback proved
  to be an effective method to promote sustainable behavior a prototype was built
  that delivers feedback on the water consumption during a shower. The feedback is
  provided by an ambient display. The shower water meter (show-me) displays the increasing
  amount of water that is used during one shower in form of LEDs assembled on a stick.
  In a user study it has shown that this approach is an effective way for initiating
  a change towards a more sustainable behavior. Furthermore, it turned out that this
  transition proceeds in three distinct phases until finally a permanent sustainable
  behavior is reached.
