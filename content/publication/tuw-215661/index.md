abstract: The purpose of the directive as a legislative act adopted by the EU (European
  Union) is to harmonize the European law by setting basic objectives to be met. The
  national au-thorities have the possibility to adjust the law within a given scope.
  One drawback of this legislative instrument is that no trivial traceability of implementa-tions
  of directives exists. Certain aspects of such an act can be implemented differently
  in different member states of the EU. Furthermore, the implementation of one part
  of a directive may be spread over several national acts. Therefore, a concept for
  the realiza-tion of an (web) application enabling the traceability of directive
  implementations across the European Union is the central aim of this thesis. At
  the beginning, boundary conditions and necessary basic decisions were evaluated.
  This includes issues like how the 23 official Union languages can be used to reach
  the biggest user community, how the content can be maintained and how up-to-dateness
  can be ensured. One data model combining specific peculiarities of the different
  law systems was de-fined. The decision was to construct documents in a tree-based
  manner for enabling the representation of implementations at different hierarchical
  layers. For this purpose, sub-parts for tree nodes and textparts for leaves were
  identified as major document ele-ments. In a next step, legal databases of Austria
  and the EU were analyzed to define require-ments a Europe-wide legal database has
  to fulfill. Documents have to be imported to the system and implementations of directives
  in national acts have to be defined. To offer a usable application, efficient search
  possibilities for document and text search need to be available. Additionally, an
  authentication concept has to be developed to restrict the access to sensitive data.
  Up-to-dateness and correctness of data is of major importance for the acceptance
  in the public. Based on the gained information, a prototypical implementation as
  a proof-of-concept was developed. One central part of this prototype was the extraction
  of data from exist-ing legal databases. For each law source, another algorithm was
  developed to gather information presented at the national institutions web pages.
  The extracted documents are stored in a tree-based format as XML-files and are stored
  in the database. A web application was implemented fulfilling the identified requirements.
  Afterwards a concise testing on functionality and performance identified high database
  resources needed due to the detailed data model as a bottleneck for the overall
  application performance.
