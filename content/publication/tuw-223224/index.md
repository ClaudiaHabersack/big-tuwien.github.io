abstract: Business transactions between companies are more and more executed by a
  flow of well-defined electronic business documents. The resulting inter-organizational
  business processes are often realized by concepts known from service-oriented computing.
  Exchanging a business document corresponds to a service call and the input/output
  of the service calls commonly follows a certain business document standard. However,
  these standards typically present the superset of all required elements used in
  any business context. In a specific context (in a specific industry, in a specific
  geopolitical region, etc.) the input/output is adjusted to this context by constraints
  on the generic structure. Accordingly, a specific service is always used in a specific
  context. It follows that it is important to define the business context of a service
  (in a structured format). For this purpose we have developed the Business Context
  Ontology model (BCOnt). In this paper we elaborate on the theoretical concepts and
  the underlying algorithms as well as on their implementation in practice.
