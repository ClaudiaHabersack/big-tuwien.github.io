abstract: UN/CEFACT's modeling methodology (UMM) is a UML profile for modeling global
  B2B choreographies. The current UMM version comprises three main views for describing
  a computation independent model from a neutral perspective. Currently, the UMM version
  is missing a platform independent model showing how each partner has to realize
  the message exchanges to support the agreed choreography. In this paper we derive
  such a platform independent model from a UMM business transaction - a key artifact
  of the computation independent model. The resulting model is based on a state machine
  describing the local view of a participating business partner. This state machine
  unambiguously defines how a business partner has to react on incoming messages and
  on message expected but not received.
