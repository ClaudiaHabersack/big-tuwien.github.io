abstract: One of the biggest challenges when introducing a Hospital  Information System
  (HIS) is the integration of the various  clinical and administrative subsystems.
  We created a proto-  type HIS to evaluate the feasibility of creating an integration  framework
  with standard open source components to over-  come this challenge. The Java implementation
  is based on  JBoss ESB and JBoss Drools. The implementation with the  exemplary
  integration of an open source ERP (Openbravo)  and open source PACS (DCM4CHEE) shows
  that this ap-  proach is feasible and results in a highly maintainable core  architecture.
