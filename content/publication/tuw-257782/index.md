abstract: 'The realization of medium-sized IT projects in virtual teams is increasingly
  gaining significance due to various and also profitable benefits, such as simpler
  and cost-effective recruitment of professionals and a greater flexibility on the
  market. However, the difficulties and problems associated with the realization of
  projects in virtual teams should not be ignored, because the occurrence of issues
  is promoted by human, team-based, cultural, linguistic, geographic, technical based
  and project type based factors. Due to these numerous challenges, which occur in
  small to mediumsized IT projects in the context of project management and virtual
  teamwork, the following research questions were formulated: (1) How could an integrated
  framework concept for project management support the collaboration in virtual teams
  in a unified way? (2) How can the feasibility of the framework concept be addressed
  by a solution prototype? The questions were answered in this thesis by a quality
  research approach, which includes a literature review, results in a detailed situation
  analysis building the basis for the developed practical concept. The practical concept
  is a rough concept for the development of a collaboration platform that unifies
  the support of the applicability of a project management standard as well as virtual
  work in medium-sized IT projects (project teams). The feasibility has been demonstrated
  by the development of a prototype. Finally, the practical concept was evaluated
  by conducting a questionnaire-based survey and the prototype by performing expert
  interviews. The evaluation has shown that the underlying idea of the practical concept
  has a practical relevance and there is a strong need for it. This conclusion is
  confirmed by the results of the conducted expert interviews. The overall evaluation
  shows that the developed prototype supports methods and functionalities in the field
  of project management and virtual teamwork that have been identified as particularly
  relevant in this thesis. Finally, it turned out that there is a great deal of interest
  in a technical solution that uniformly supports the application of a project management
  approach and the collaboration in virtual IT project teams.'
