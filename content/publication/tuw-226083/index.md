abstract: The increasing complexity of software and IT systems creates the necessity
  for research on technologies addressing current key security challenges. To meet
  security requirements in IT infrastructures, a security engineering process has
  to be established. One crucial factor contributing to a higher level of security
  is the reliable detection of security vulnerabilities during security tests. In
  the presented approach, we observe the behavior of the system under test and introduce
  machine learning methods based on derived behavior metrics. This is a generic method
  for different test targets which improves the accuracy of the security test result
  of an automated security testing approach. Reliable automated determination of security
  failures in security test results increases the security quality of the tested software
  and avoids costly manual validation.
