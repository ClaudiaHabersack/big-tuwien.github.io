abstract: Due to company mergers and business to business<br> interoperability, there
  is a need for model<br> transformations in the area of business process<br> modeling
  to facilitate scenarios like model integration<br> and model synchronization. General
  model<br> transformation approaches do not consider the special<br> properties of
  business process models and horizontal<br> transformation scenarios. Therefore,
  we propose a<br> model transformation approach based on domainspecific<br> patterns
  which are applied for analyzing<br> business process models in a precise way. This<br>
  approach facilitates the definition of business process<br> model transformations,
  which can be easily adapted to<br> different business process modeling languages
  and<br> specific transformation problems. At the same time it<br> supports the intuitive
  understanding of the domainexperts<br> in business process modeling.
