abstract: Abstract-Knowing how a software project is likely to evolve is  an essential
  problem for any software project manager. Finding  ef&#64257;cient predictors for
  performance indicators (e.g., bugrates)  has been the focus of many studies. Previous
  studies found  that process metrics make likely candidates for this predictor  role,
  for bug data in particular. We propose a methodology  for in-depth analysis of process
  metrics to &#64257;nd out how they  relate to changes. We use a lexical approach
  to classify changes  into perfective, adaptive and corrective changes. The analysis  consists
  of examining a set of hypotheses on the nature of the  relationship of certain process
  metrics and the change categories,  e.g., perfective changes and their impact on
  the consecutive bug  appearance rate of a module. As this work is in progress, we  present
  a pilot study on a module of the Ant Project to showcase  and discuss our technique
  and point out early trends.
