abstract: A great challenge of test management within a software development project
  is the definition of an appropriate, customized and integrated test process. The
  thesis deals with this particular task within the scope of a case study in the field
  of airport ground operation systems by building an Airport Operational Database
  (AODB). The designed test process builds on the major test standards in the field
  of testing (IEEE 829, TMMi, ISTQB Glossary, ISO/IEC 29119) and further on the identified
  project specific characteristics and requirements, as for instance in-house-development,
  geographically distributed team and agile principles as pair programming and pair
  testing. The observation of the processes detected that as in many agile projects
  there is a particular focus on verbal communication. However this results often
  in repetitive know-how transfer. In order to solve this issue the analysis of use
  cases has been merged for developers and testers for guaranteeing a unified level
  of knowledge. Moreover an exact hierarchy of information retrieval has been set
  up. Furthermore the process has been designed to act as a feedback loop to every
  member in the project. Similar to pair programming in software development, for
  testing tasks pair testing is applied. Thereby the test process functions as a central
  node in the information transfer of the team members. In order to test the functionalities
  more accurately several test items has been identified as architecture, group of
  uses cases, single use case and user groups. Within these test items the tester
  is supposed to determine the test method (black box, grey box, white box) and the
  test level (acceptance, system, integration, unit). According to this three dimensional
  matrix it is specified how the test cases should be composed. The process is implemented
  into the Squash Test Management tool. Squash TM has been configured in terms of
  influencing the current processes minimally and support it optimally, while easing
  the tasks of testers. Accordingly requirements, test cases, test plans, test campaigns
  test iterations and partly test documents can be managed via the tool. Test documentation
  has been designed based on the IEEE 829 standard and has been implemented either
  in Squash or in the project management tool, Redmine depending on the targeted user
  group of the document. Finally the optimized and tailored test process has been
  evaluated according to the TMMi assessment criteria and the results have been summarized
  in an overview table.
