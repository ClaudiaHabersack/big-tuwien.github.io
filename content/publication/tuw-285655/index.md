abstract: The so-called "refugee crisis" in 2015 overstrained the European authorities
  and people seeking for help. Many refugee camps in Europe were not adequately prepared
  and had to process a large number of people. There was no standardized way to handle
  and coordinate people within a refugee camp. The EU Member States defined different
  approaches to identify and register refugees on their territory. The authors already
  proposed a standardized refugee management system concept that should enhance the
  identification and registration process in a European refugee camp. They introduced
  14 functional requirement areas and evaluated them through qualitative research
  with experts and national authorities. Due to ethical and organizational issues,
  the authors decided to apply a quantitative survey about the acceptance of the proposed
  system requirements, which are presented in this paper. Several national and European
  institutions, companies, and scientists who are involved in the refugee administration
  should demonstrate the practicability of the proposed system. The results of the
  survey affirmed the general acceptance of all requirement areas. Furthermore, the
  authors analyzed the given answers in more detail to understand why specific branches
  accepted or declined the requirement areas.
