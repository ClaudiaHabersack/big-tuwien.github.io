abstract: The recent inception of smart contracts in cryptocurrency systems like Ethereum,
  enabling the decentralized computation of programs on a blockchain, offers a lot
  of potential applications and savings in a banking context. But there are few concrete
  implementations and scientific works dealing with the potentials of tokenizing securities
  to be traded on a blockchain. This thesis explores, how a system, that enables retail
  banks to bring conventional securities on a blockchain ledger, can be designed and
  built in order to capitalize on this potential. To this end, other systems, that
  could potentially fulfill a similar role are reviewed and analyzed for their usability
  in this scope and checked for promising standards for securities on a blockchain.
  A prototype of such a system is created based on the ERC-1400 group of token standards,
  requirements elicited from existing projects and legal needs. The smart contract
  prototype represents conventional securities on an Ethereum blockchain and includes
  features like Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) restrictions,
  dividend payment, and shareholder voting. It is configurable and upgradeable while
  deployed, making it an extendable base for real-world applications. The prototype
  shows the potential, as well as the issues such a system needs to address. Its shortcomings
  show possible directions for future research, such as privacy concerns and legal
  compliance of such operations. Finally, this thesis should inspire further work
  and research in this field, to help improve on the efficiency of banking processes.
