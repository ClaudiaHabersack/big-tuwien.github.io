abstract: In the past few years the mobile market experienced a large inflation. This
  trend subsequently lead to more powerful devices with a wide range of functionalities.
  To ensure the quality of mobile applications is vital and many frameworks provide
  excellent support in quality assurance. However, the fast growing market and emerging
  fields of use present software testers with new challenges. Apps do no longer just
  interact with the mobile phonesÂ´ hardware itself, but also use wireless tech- nologies,
  e.g. NFC, to exchange data. The additional hardware makes testing a tedious job.
  This thesis discusses the need for a robot-assisted testing approach in a contactless
  NFC point-of-sale payment system. Although the test cases for the software itself
  can be automated, the entire pro- cess of testing the system against all NFC-smartcards
  requires continuous human interaction. Thus testing gets tiresome and facilitates
  failure due to human error. Test automation is a substantial issue and therefore
  a robot, which takes care of managing the set of NFC-smartcards, is designed and
  integrated into the testing process of a showcase payment project. Furthermore a
  framework, managing the interaction between tools for testmanagement- and testautomation,
  has been devel- oped. With the aid of the framework even not particularly trained
  testers are able to execute the NFC payment tests and furthermore all test results
  are persisted within the testmanagement tool automatically. At first, basic knowledge
  about testing and robot-assisted testing is provided. The next section presents
  insides of the showcase payment system and shows in what manner the robot-assisted
  testautomation fits into the testing process. The main chapter of this thesis is
  about the design and implementation of the interface framework and the test robot.
  In addition to the core functionalities of the framework this section presents sample
  modules to use with the showcase project. The thesis concludes with a discussion
  of the gathered results and lists further possible applications of the established
  solution.
