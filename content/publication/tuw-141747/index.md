abstract: We present a novel concept for an audience voting system for judged sports
  events. It is based on wireless wearable motion sensors utilizing the natural behaviour
  ofsports spectators - clapping and cheering. This paper describes initial results
  from a user study that guided our design process. We further present two preliminary
  prototypes focusing on hardware and design feasibility respectively. Results confirm
  our assumption that the system does not provide objective results, but has the potential
  to increase the spectator experience by giving audience members the feeling of being
  part of the voting process.
