abstract: Since the invention of the telephone about 150 years ago, communication
  systems have been subject to continuous improvement and form an important factor
  in modern life. Current development favors Voice over IP based systems, which utilize
  regular Internet infrastructure and their advantages. Also the ongoing evolvement
  of software development enables open source products to mature and to form a viable
  alternative to other software design approaches. The designers of open source private
  branch exchange (PBX) Asterisk pursue utilizing open source software for the development
  of a Voice over IP systems. As it combines advantages of both, open source software
  and Voice over IP systems, a promising future of Asterisk is guaranteed. Although
  great benefit can be achieved, the openness of and integration into regular Internet
  infrastructure evokes doubts about the security of the system. This thesis presents
  an approach to point out potential security threats of an open source PBX system,
  to analyize their system vulnerabilities and to estimate the risk of such vulnerabilities
  getting exposed. For an Asterisk based reference system, mitigation strategies for
  identified risk are presented.
