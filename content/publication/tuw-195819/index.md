abstract: 'The growing trend towards mobile phones with integrated GPS clearly suggests
  that navigation and location-based services (LBS) will be key applications for future
  mobile devices. New hardware features that are currently finding their way into
  state-of-the-art phones - such as digital compasses and tilt sensors - promise to
  drive the adoption of mobile geospatial services, and to change the way people navigate,
  explore and interact with their physical environment: location-based applications
  that exploit attitude information to realise orientation-aware interaction have
  been discussed in research for several years. Yet, few actual results on the achievable
  real-world performance of such systems exist in literature. In this article, we
  report on a series of function trials carried out with a prototype Geo-Wand - a
  portable system that allows users to access geo-referenced information by physically
  pointing towards objects in the real world. The application was realised with a
  mass market mobile phone connected to a Bluetooth GPS and a custom-built orientation
  sensor module. We present test results for multiple types of urban terrain and discuss
  the possibilities and limitations of this next-generation mobile LBS technology.'
