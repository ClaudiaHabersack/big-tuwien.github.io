abstract: Growing access to qualified medical information triggers interest and helps
  patients with their medical conditions, get second opinions, or just share some
  experience with others. To explore the thoughts of digital natives - what information
  is accepted and sought after and what information is considered irrelevant or unnecessary
  - in health information systems, a quantitative survey, from the end users´ point
  of view, with 56 people was conducted. The sample consisted of semi-digital natives
  aged between 18 and 35. The main results show that a large number of people (78.6%)
  do an online research after a doctor´s consultation. In terms of second opinion,
  only 33.9% would in principle consider taking a second opinion from online health
  consulting.
