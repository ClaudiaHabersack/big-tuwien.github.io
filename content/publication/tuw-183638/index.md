abstract: Water is a scarce resource worldwide. Yet, we have many  opportunities to
  conserve it. One particular opportunity for water  conservation is the shower, because
  depending on the shower  head and shower habits, an individual can save many liters
  of  fresh water each day. Feedback proved to be an effective method  to promote
  sustainable behavior. Therefore, in this paper we  suggest to promote water conservation
  by providing feedback in  form of an ambient display that can easily be integrated
  in current  shower types. We built a prototype to study the potential of such a  feedback
  device. These shower water meter (show-me) display  the amount of water, that is
  used during one shower in form of  LEDs assembled on a stick. Thus, an increasing
  water level is  visualized. The user study revealed two groups. The subjects who  considered
  themselves as ecologically conscious changed their  behavior and turned the water
  down or off while soaping. Also,  they are willing to pursue this behavior. Other
  subjects who did  not have the goal to act more sustainable, were surprised about  their
  water consumption and tried to reduce it. However, after the  removal of the show-me
  device they did not maintain their  behavior and fell back into their previous habit.
