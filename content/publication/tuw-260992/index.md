abstract: Smart manufacturing requires deeply integrated IT systems in order to foster
  flexibility in the setup, re-arrangement and use of attached manufacturing systems.
  In a vertical integration scenario, IT systems of different vendors might be in
  use and proprietary interfaces need to defined in order to allow the exchange of
  relevant information from one system to another. In this paper we present a model-driven
  approach for vertical integration of IT systems. It is based on the application
  of industry standards for the representation of hierarchy level specific system
  properties and an alignment of their key concepts in order to provide bridging functions
  for the transformation between the different systems.
