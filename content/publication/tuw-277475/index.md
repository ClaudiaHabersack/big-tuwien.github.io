abstract: Diabetes mellitus is affecting a wide range of people around the world.
  There is no cure, therefore people need to live with that disease for a long time.
  Suffering from diabetes mellitus means that the insulin regulation inside the body
  is not working correctly and must therefore be monitored very carefully ending up
  with documenting the blood glucose level and the complete nutrition intake. This
  is still very often a paper based and not really motivating or diversified process
  with the help of so called diabetes diaries. Today's society also delivers mobile
  solutions even with gamification elements, but the combination of monitoring blood
  glucose level and a complete independent/not directly related game was not yet the
  State of The Art focus. As a result, the authors of this publication present a game,
  where people get benefits from entering their blood glucose measurements and nutrition
  intake in an included digital diabetes diary. By including 21 people suffering from
  type 1 or 2 diabetes it was shown, that such a solution poses a motivating aspect
  in their daily lives and differs from current software solutions. Throughout different
  iterations, 29 functional requirements were identified and described. Within a five
  week test phase, the participants played 178 game sessions and entered 1102 diary
  entries.
