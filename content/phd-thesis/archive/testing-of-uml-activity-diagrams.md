In model-driven development, modeling languages provide the means for software development on a higher level of abstraction than traditional general purpose languages. However, compared to general purpose languages, these modeling languages often lack the proper tool support, such as tools for debugging and testing. Especially testing is essential to achieve a high quality of the final software product. In this work, we propose an approach for testing UML models at the model level to ensure the validation of their quality before the executable code is produced out of these models. In particular, we propose a dedicated testing language for specifying and executing test scenarios of UML activity diagrams based on OMGâ€™s fUML standard.
