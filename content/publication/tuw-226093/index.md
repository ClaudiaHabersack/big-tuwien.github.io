abstract: Distributed development within a single organization adds a lot of overhead
  to every software development process. When a second organization joins for co-development,
  complexity reaches the next level. This case study investigates an agile approach
  from a real world project involving two unaffiliated IT organizations that collaborate
  in a distributed development environment. Adaptations to the regular Scrum process
  are identified and evaluated over a six-month-long period of time. The evaluation
  involves a detailed problem root cause analysis and suggestions on what issues to
  act first. Key lessons learned include that team members of one Scrum team should
  not be distributed over several sites and that every site should have at least one
  Scrum master and one product owner.
