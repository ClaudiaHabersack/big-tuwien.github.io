abstract: An accounting information system (AIS) manages data about a company's financial
  and economic status. The contribution of this paper is closing the gap between the
  languages used by business domain experts and IT-experts in analyzing the relevant
  data. A well accepted approach scrutinizing an accountability infrastructure is
  the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology. Although REA has been based on well-established
  concepts of the accounting theory, its representation has not been intuitive to
  domain experts. In previous work, we developed the REA-DSL, a dedicated and easy-to-understand
  graphical domain specific modeling language for the REA ontology. Evidently, a model-driven
  approach requires to transform the REA-DSL artifacts to code. In this paper we present
  the transformation of the REA-DSL to a relational database for AIS. This approach
  offers the advantage that a domain expert verifies the relevant data in an "accounting
  language", whereas the IT expert is able to work with traditional data base structures.
