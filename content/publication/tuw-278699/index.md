abstract: Variability is crucial in the design of many advanced goods and it is also
  receiving increasing attention in production systems engineering. Since OPC Unified
  Architecture plays an important role when it comes to standardized information exchange
  in modern production systems, it can be a melting pot for information from various
  engineering domains, such as product design and production engineering - thus, it
  is an ideal place to hold variability information of products and production systems
  alike. Based on an initial variability information model we propose additional concepts
  for the persisting of configurations.
