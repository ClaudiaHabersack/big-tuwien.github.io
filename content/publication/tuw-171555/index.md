abstract: Workflow technology promises an increase in efficiency in the execution
  of business processes. The technology is widely accepted, but often the high costs
  exceed the promised benefits. This is due to the fact that companies do not carefully
  select the business processes for automation by workflow management systems (WFMS).
  They also implement processes that have an unappropriate structures for automation
  and/or that are economically irrelevant. <br> This paper presents an evaluation
  framework that enables a selection of appropriate business processes. Currently
  there does not exist any suitable evaluation framework. The framework considers
  criteria for technical feasibility, economic potential and organizational aspects.
  The scoring model based on these criteria follows a multi factor analysis and leads
  to a process-automation portfolio enabling the selection of appropriate business
  processes. The framework has been successfully used in the IT company of an banking
  corporation.
