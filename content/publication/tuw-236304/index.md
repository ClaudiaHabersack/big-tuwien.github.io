abstract: Response rate and residence time are critical factors for the success of
  online surveys. Both can be increased through improved user experience. Gamification
  promises better user experience by integrating playful elements. This work presents
  method for gamifying online surveys. At the beginning, game elements which suite
  to online surveys and areas in which they are used efficiently, were validated.
  By using the MDA-model, the collected game elements where broken down into mechanic,
  dynamic and aesthetic aspects. The resulting design space represents the base of
  the method. The application of the method is iterative and begins with the analysis
  phase. In this step, game elements are determined, which are integrated in the surveys.
  By using the MDA-model, game elements were integrated into the survey. After the
  completion of the gamified online survey, a summative evaluation is done by an expert
  with regards to survey design. In an interview, the embedding of the individual
  game elements and the resulting outcome will be assessed. The practical applicability
  of the proposed method for the gamification of online surveys is illustrated by
  a case study. During the iterative development process, user tests are used for
  evaluating the method. It offers designers a structured process model, inspiration
  regarding design options and decision support for design decisions.
