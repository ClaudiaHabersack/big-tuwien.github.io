abstract: The most prominent business ontology for accounting information systems
  is the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology developed by McCarthy, Geerts and others.
  REA is a widely accepted framework for the design of a conceptual model of the accountability
  infrastructure of enterprise information systems. Originally, REA targeted the resource
  flows within and between companies describing what is currently occurring and what
  has occurred in the past. This is known as the operational layer. Later it was extended
  by a planning layer and a policy layer capturing what should, could, or must be
  occurring sometime in the future. Today, REA may be considered as a powerful business
  ontology capturing all relevant data to generate the conceptual design of an Accounting
  Information System (AIS). However, we feel that it does not deliver an appropriate
  representation of the business model which can be understood not only by the IT
  expert, but also by the business expert. Thus, the use of REA in the design of AIS
  does not yet reach its full potential. We argue, that an easy-to-understand REA
  notation will accelerate, streamline, and reduce the costs of the AIS development
  process.  Consequently, we have developed a domain specific modeling language for
  the REA concepts called the REA-DSL which aims at both (i) delivering an intuitive
  REA notation and (ii) retaining the full expressiveness of the REA concepts. The
  step we are conducting right now and covering in this paper is the incorporation
  of properties and primary keys into our REA-DSL and the final automatic generation
  of an Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD) for an AIS from the REA-DSL using our tool.
