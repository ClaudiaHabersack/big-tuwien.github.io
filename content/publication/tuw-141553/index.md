abstract: Due to the liberalisation of the energy market, energy providing companies
  have to offer an efficient customer service in order to stay competitive. Introducing
  a customer portal qualifies to be a platform to respite the intense data interaction
  between big business customers and energy providers and to make the customer process
  more efficient and clearer. Whilst nowadays most energy providing companies don´t
  offer customer portals this thesis discusses the requirements to a customer portal
  and the most important success criteria for its introduction on the basis of a real
  world case study. The requirements have been determined on a functional and a technical
  point of view. Initially the in the literature available requirements have been
  analysed and the most important requirements for energy providing companies have
  been collected. For implementing the technical requirements different approaches
  have been compared and evaluated to select the most adequate for reflecting this
  method in depth. A further focus in this paper was a broad survey of customers of
  energy providing companies. This survey showed that most of the interviewed companies
  desire access to a customer portal whereas the most demanded functions were an overview
  of daily usage data, a demand set overview and the possibility to enter their counter
  reading. Finally a process model for introducing customer portals in energy providing
  companies has been developed on the basis of already existing models.
