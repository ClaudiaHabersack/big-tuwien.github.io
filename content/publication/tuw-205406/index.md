abstract: Since several years the number of VoIP (Voice over  IP) infrastructures
  increases and, consequently, the number of  VoIP users increases too. Under these
  circumstances VoIP systems  get more and more attractive for attackers, since the
  probability  of successful attacks increases and attackers gain bene&#64257;ts,
  e.g.,  money with fee-based telephone numbers. Therefore, this paper  describes
  a solution to capture, monitor and report VoIP attacks  to gain more knowledge on
  current and new VoIP attacks.
