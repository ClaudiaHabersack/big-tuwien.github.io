abstract: In the information society of today, we are interacting with computing devices
  on a daily basis. While they are a valuable tool for retrieving information, it
  can be sometimes frustrating for users to access this information. This is especially
  the case when they want to maintain a constant awareness of information. The concept
  of ambient display suggests the integration of computing technologies into everyday
  environments to support monitoring of information at the periphery of users' attention.
  This thesis investigates the architectural ceiling for ambient display of information
  that is non-obtrusive, always available, and can be accessed by simply looking upwards.
  Various related fields are investigated that provide an important foundation for
  the research work described in this thesis, such as historical ceiling frescos,
  interactive architecture and ubiquitous computing. Using an explorative research
  approach, five feasibility studies were conducted to explore application scenarios
  and develop proof-of-concept prototypes for interactive ceilings. The results from
  the studies and insights from the literature review are conveyed in a framework
  for ceiling interaction, which serves as a tool for design and research in the field
  of interactive ceilings. Based on the literature review and the experience from
  developing the prototypes, design guidelines are suggested to further guide future
  research in this field. A conclusion derived from this work is that interactive
  ceilings are especially suited for visualizing spatial data, such as sound or environmental
  conditions, since they allow for visually mapping their location in space onto the
  ceiling. Further the aesthetic integration into the existing architectural environment
  is of vital importance to assure user acceptance.
