abstract: Today, knowledge management is a crucial component for enterprises and it
  is fundamental for the corporate and organizational practice. According to various
  perspectives di fferent tasks can be assigned to knowledge management. Groupware
  collaboration can be seen as an important tool in information technology. It is
  a complex subject being dealt in a lot of scienti c works. The combination of two
  concepts, both knowledge management and collaboration, realised by using groupware
  software, is decisive for the success of enterprises in know-how intensive branches.
  Scope of this master thesis is the analysis of catalysator e ects of groupware in
  the sector of knowledge management of small and medium sized enterprises (SME).
  First of all to achieve this scope, theoretical concepts like scienti c knowledge
  management models of Nonaka/Takeuchi, Probst and Pawlowsky are worked out. Furthermore
  the needs of enterprises, as far as knowlegde management is concerned, will be discussed.
  Nowadays, companies are facing a more and more intensively competitive knowledge
  economy, where knowledge is playing an increasingly important role as well as the
  complexity of this reality and the data ood are becoming enourmous challenges for
  enterprises. To cope with these challenges, an e ffective knowledge management must
  be implemented. This kind of knowledge management can cope with various tasks depending
  on the purpose and coporate goals, but it uses this kind of systems based on groupware
  This type of knowledge management can deal with various tasks depending on the purpose
  and corporate goals, but it uses this kind of system based on groupware All factors
  concerning selection, success and risks of such a system are anaylised in this scienti
  c work and they show an enourmous potential for solutions under certain circumstances.
  Therefore an empiric enterprise study about three selected corporations is carried
  out to gain practical aspects of knowledge management. This method enables a comparison
  between theoretical and practical aspects of knowledge management. One main focus
  of this scienti c work is the deduction of catalysator e ects in small and medium
  sized enterprises in the eld of knowledge management. General conditions of these
  catalysator e ects are deducted as well. As a consequence, reductions in costs and
  in time as well as an increase of quality standards can be achieved if an optimized
  group-based knowledgement management system is implemented. Moreover, design recommendations
  for the e ffective use of knowledge management and knowledge management systems
  are given. In addition to that a procedure model for the integration of knowledge
  management systems into an already similar existing one and into its process landscape
  is deducted.
