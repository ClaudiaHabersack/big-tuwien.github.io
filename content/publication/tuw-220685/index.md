abstract: Today, business processes are modeled without taking into deeper consideration
  the context of the business environment where they will be later executed. As a
  consequence, initiation, management and delayed adjustments of business processes
  are demanding, time-consuming and very often impossible tasks. In this paper we
  summarize crucial advantages and disadvantages of different Context modeling approaches,
  and we define the Context related to the scope of the business environment particularly.
  If we could assign a Business Context to a business process, we could undermine
  negative trends in today's business, such as interoperability issues, inconsistencies
  and heterogeneous interpretations of different business processes.
