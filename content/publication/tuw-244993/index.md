abstract: 'Companies are increasingly embedded in B2B environments, where they have
  to collaborate in order to achieve their goals. Such collaborations lead to inter-organizational
  business processes that may be commonly supported through the exchange of electronic
  data interchange (EDI) messages (e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.).
  Despite the appearance of XML, traditional approaches to EDI, such as EDIFACT and
  ANSI X.12, still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. However, such traditional
  EDI standards lack a notion of process. In other words, the exchanged business documents
  are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged business documents.
  This has two shortcomings: (1) the inability to apply proven business process management
  (BPM) methods, including process mining techniques, in such settings; and (2) the
  unavailability of systematic approaches to business intelligence (BI) using information
  from exchanged EDI messages. In this article, we present the EDImine Framework for
  enabling (1) the application of process mining techniques in the field of EDI-supported
  inter-organizational business processes, and (2) for supporting inter-organizational
  performance evaluation using business information from EDI messages, event logs
  and process models. As an enabling technology, we present a method for the semantic
  preprocessing of EDIFACT messages to exploit this potentially rich source of information
  by applying state of the art BPM and BI techniques. We show the applicability of
  our approach by means of a case study based on real-world EDI data of a German consumer
  goods manufacturing company.'
