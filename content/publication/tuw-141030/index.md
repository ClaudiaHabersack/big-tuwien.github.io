abstract: Not least due to the widespread use of meta modeling concepts, model transformation
  techniques have reached a certain level of maturity (Czarnecki and Helsen, 2006).
  Nevertheless, defining transformations in some application areas in our case business
  process modeling is still a challenge because current transformation languages provide
  general solutions but do not support issues specific to a distinct area. We aim
  at providing generic solutions for model transformation problems distinct to the
  area of horizontal business process model transformations. As a first step in this
  endeavor, this work reports on the most pressing problems encountered at defining
  business process model transformations.
