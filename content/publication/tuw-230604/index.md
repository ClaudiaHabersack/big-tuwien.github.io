abstract: The large scale of the Internet has offered unique economic opportunities,
  that in turn introduce overwhelming challenges for development and operations to
  provide reliable and fast services in order to meet the high demands on the performance
  of online services. In this paper, we investigate how performance engineers can
  identify three different classes of externally-visible performance problems (global
  delays, partial delays, periodic delays) from concrete traces. We develop a simulation
  model based on a taxonomy of root causes in server performance degradation. Within
  an experimental setup, we obtain results through synthetic monitoring of a targetWeb
  service, and observe changes inWeb performance over time through exploratory visual
  analysis and changepoint detection. Finally, we interpret our findings and discuss
  various challenges and pitfalls.
