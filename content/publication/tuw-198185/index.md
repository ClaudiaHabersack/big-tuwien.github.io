abstract: In the discipline of accounting, the resource-event-agent (REA) ontology
  is a well accepted conceptual accounting framework to analyze the economic phenomena
  within and across enterprises. Accordingly, it seems to be appropriate to use REA
  in the requirements elicitation to develop an information architecture of accounting
  and enterprise information systems. However, REA has received comparatively less
  attention in the field of business informatics and computer science. Some of the
  reasons may be that the REA ontology despite of its well grounded core concepts
  is (1) sometimes vague in the definition of the relationships between these core
  concepts, (2) misses a precise language to describe the models, and (3) does not
  come with an easy to understand graphical notation. Accordingly, we have started
  developing a domain specific modeling language specifically dedicated to REA models
  and corresponding tool support to overcome these limitations. In this paper we present
  our REA DSL which supports the basic set of REA concepts.
