abstract: OPC Unified Architecture (UA) is a powerful and versatile platform for hosting
  information from a large variety of domains. In some cases, the domain-specific
  information models provide overlapping information, such as (i) different views
  on a specific entity or (ii) different levels of detail of a single entity. Emerging
  from a multi-disciplinary engineering process, these different views can stem from
  various tools that have been used to deal with that entity, or from different stages
  in an engineering process, e.g., from requirements engineering over system design
  and implementation to operations. In this work, we provide a small but expressive
  set of OPC UA reference types that unobtrusively allow the persistent instantiation
  of additional knowledge with respect to relations between OPC UA nodes. We will
  show the application of these reference types on the basis of a rendezvous of AutomationML
  and ISA-95 in an OPC UA server.
