abstract: Real-world tagging technologies, such as RFID or visual codes, have enabled
  new application scenarios that foster mobile interaction with the physical world.
  While the application scenarios are promising for many contexts, the technologies
  are currently lacking accessibility. Especially blind and visually impaired people
  are not able to interact with tags if they are not aware of their presence. We propose
  audio-tactile location  markers as a remedy to this problem. An audible signal leads
  users to the tag, which can be identified through tactile exploration. Preliminary
  user studies with four blindfolded subjects using an initial prototype showed the
  applicability of using an audible signal for locating tags.
