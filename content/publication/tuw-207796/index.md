abstract: Shape grammars have been introduced in architectural theory some decades
  ago. They have been applied to architectural construction methods (e.g. Chinese
  traditional wooden buildings) or for analyzing the design patterns of well-known
  architects (e.g. Palladio, Frank Lloyd-Wright). These examples demonstrated that
  complex geometrical shapes could be generated by a set of replacement rules out
  of a start symbol, usually a simple geometric shape. With the advent of powerful
  tools like the CityEngine an interesting field for practical applications of these
  grammars arose opening a whole range of new possibilities for architectural heritage.
  On the one hand, a description of ancient building principles in the formalized
  way of a shape grammar can aid the understanding and preservation of cultural heritage.
  With the possibility to actually construct digital 3D models out of shape grammars,
  they became even more interesting. Furthermore, this approach allows for a large
  scale creation of 3D models of entire settlements and cities. On the other hand,
  shape grammars allow for structured approaches to virtual 3D reconstruction as has
  been demonstrated for e.g. Mayan or Roman architecture. Besides that, the possibility
  to specify parameterized variations of the models proves to be an extremely helpful
  feature. In this paper we reconsider shape grammars in architecture and examine
  influences onto procedural modelling. Then we argue for state-of-the-art tools like
  the CityEngine that apply shape grammars and procedural modelling in architectural
  contexts and exemplify their power and potential by reconstructing traditional Balinese
  settlements.
