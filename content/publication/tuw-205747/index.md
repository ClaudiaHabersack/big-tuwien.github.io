abstract: Nowadays electronic health records are evaluated  and implemented worldwide.
  Future stakeholders, especially  patients are not always integrated into all aspects
  of this  process. An important problem with the rollout of a  countrywide e-health
  project is the unequal distribution of the  access to modern media, especially to
  computer and internet  ("regional digital gap"), of people living in urban and rural  areas
  - and if there are differences regarding the usage of an  electronic health record
  between these two groups. Differences  in these aspects between urban and rural
  areas where  evaluated using an empirical trial. This qualitative survey was  based
  on 20 interviews focused on the discrepancy between  urban and rural areas regarding
  the opinion on the electronic  health record in Austria. The results show that differences
  in  some aspects regarding "personal data input", "health  information", "own usage"
  and "data abuse" of an electronic  health record exists.
