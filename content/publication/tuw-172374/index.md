abstract: We propose a conceptual design framework for the  classification and design
  of applications that augment  architectural environments with digital information.
  The  dimensions of the framework consist of the layers that  compose architectural
  space (fa√ßade, interior and structure)  and its embodiments (expressive medium,
  responsive space  and social actor). We further introduce design  characteristics
  for each application area within the  framework. Accordingly, we describe two conceptual  prototypes
  that we developed to investigate the validity of  the framework as a conceptual
  design tool.
