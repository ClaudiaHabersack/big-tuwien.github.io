abstract: In modern e-government administrations, regulatory documents are not only
  drafted using  computer tools but are increasingly managed using Electronic Record
  Systems (ERS). Such tools mean that coordination and administrative procedures do
  not only have to occur via e-mail or similar technologies. To execute the next administrational
  step using traditional methods, each officer has to know the inner organisational
  workflow and therefore those clerks responsible for performing the next administrational
  step to be able to forward the record to the correct person. Though till now this
  way of working has been quite common in many official organisations, there are a
  considerable number of software products available, which implement ERS, to assist
  performing administrative procedures  electronically. When an officer has finished
  his respective process step, such a system automatically forwards the documents
  to the next responsible person. Moreover if several clerks have to perform a step
  in parallel, it is not necessary to copy the whole file several times but only to
  grant appropriate access permissions to the documents. Thus at any moment, everyone
  has the record in its latest version. Furthermore the whole administrative act can
  be tracked and monitored. It is important to remember however that within the European
  Union a couple of regulatory rules have to be obeyed when implementing and using
  such ERS. The providers of such systems as well as the authority using them are
  responsible for ensuring legal conformity. The aim of this paper is to give a brief
  overview of the applicable European regulations concerning ERS for responsible stakeholders,
  such as IT-system designers and providers, administration chiefs, or researchers
  in the field of e-government.
