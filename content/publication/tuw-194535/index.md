abstract: Location-based services (LBS) are services providing information related
  to the current geographic position of the user. They are primarily used on mobile
  devices like mobile phones or PDAs. The "LBScult project" was a research project
  with the goal to develop a prototype for a location-based service for the City of
  Vienna. Therefore different data sources like the Register of Cultural Goods ("Kulturgüterkataster")
  of the Vienna City Council and the so called "Wien Kartei" of the Austrian National
  Library had been integrated. Although a monolithic architecture has been planned
  initially, the architecture evolved step by step towards a service-oriented architecture
  (SOA). The service-oriented architecture is an architectural style which allows
  creating complex systems by combining simple services. Because a location-based
  service consists of several services on its own, it can be realized using a service-oriented
  style. This diploma thesis gives an detailed introduction to the topics "location-based
  services" and the "service-oriented architecture". The LBScult project and its development
  towards a SOA are explained too. As the outcome of this thesis the "SOAfied Location-Based
  Service" is presented. It is a generic concept how to implement a location-based
  service within a service-oriented architecture. This concept includes an architectural
  model, service descriptions and descriptions of different types of connections between
  mobile devices and the services.
