abstract: The paper deals with the evaluation of shared services  for information
  systems as an approachfor optimizing  IS costs. The consolidation of IS processes
  and re-  sources in a shared service centre can be useful if  independent IS departments
  with redundant services  exist after a merger, in conglomerates or in other  kinds
  of co-operation.  Six case studies are presented in the paper. Thecase  studies
  are characterized bya difference between the  management expectations before start
  of shared ser-  vice evaluationand the resultsafter investigation. The  reasons
  for the discrepancies give an input under  which circumstances shared service considerations  can
  succeed and when they possibly fail. The outcome  leads to corresponding recommendations.  The
  paper touches the change of management position  to the question of core business,
  the synergy pyramid  explaining when sufficient cost reduction can be ex-  pected,
  the over-and underestimating of implementa-  tion costs and the involvement of staff
  in the decision  process.
