abstract: Accelerated by the big success of leading social web services like Facebook,
  Flickr, Twitter or YouTube and the request of exciting features through the web
  community, a new genre of innovative online marketplaces has evolved over the last
  years. Smart Shopping Spaces provide a unique shopping experience characterized
  by strong collaboration and social interaction between merchants and consumers.
  Conventional online shops are gradually updated with innovative shopping features
  or become fully substituted by new e-shopping concepts, like Fruugo, MyDeco, Threadless
  or Vente Priv√©e. This paper presents a trendsetting model for Smart Shopping Spaces
  based on analyzed best practice elements, functionalities and interactions. The
  designed model combines components of social networking, online shopping and social
  commerce services. An extended research on 300 individual services out of these
  three categories was performed to achieve a broad overview. Relevant research results,
  significant showcases as well as the creation process and an explanation of the
  model are presented. The framework illustrated in the final part serves as basis
  for both researchers and developers of future Smart Shopping Spaces.
