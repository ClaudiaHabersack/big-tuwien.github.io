abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and e-Health are buzzwords which frequently
  occour in the media nowadays. Nationwide systems, which supply citizens with EHRs,
  are currently being developed worldwide and such systems will also be introduced
  in Germany and Austria in the near future. This paper is about the conceptual design
  of an EHR named LISAME (Liber salutis meae - My health book). It focuses especially
  on research and teaching at the Technical University of Vienna (TU-Vienna). With
  LISAME it should be possible to solve problems and discuss questions concerning
  EHRs. Therefore the fields of research are very versatile and reach from semantic
  data storage to usability-optimization. Beginning with the definition of useful
  terms and concepts, an introduction into relevant standards follows. Furthermore
  already realized projects in connection with EHRs from Germany and Austria are described.
  The next part deals with identifying the actors and functions of such a system.
  Based on this knowledge use case diagrams are modeled. In conclusion a forecast
  to possible future work and their practical use is given. This master thesis specifies
  the functional range of this EHR and describes all use cases in detail in the UML-notation.
  It is part of the project LISAME, where more papers concerning the architecture
  and the realization of this EHR will follow.
