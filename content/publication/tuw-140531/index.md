abstract: 'UN/CEFACTÂ´s Modeling Methodology (UMM) is a well<br> accepted approach
  to define inter-organizational business<br> processes. UMM models should be managed
  in a registry<br> for two reasons: Firstly, business partners supporting the<br>
  process can find it and bind to it. Secondly, a model -<br> or more important parts
  thereof - may be reused in another<br> model of an inter-organizational process.
  Accordingly,<br> registering one model as one object in a registry<br> is not appropriate.
  Those parts of a model that may be<br> reused must become registry objects themselves.
  Extracting<br> parts of a model results in objects that are logically<br> inter-related.
  Thus, a registry model taking care of these<br> inter-relationships is needed. In
  this paper we present a<br> so-called business collaboration registry model that
  sits on<br> top of the ebRIM (ebXML registry information model) in<br> order to
  manage UMM business collaboration models in an<br> ebXML registry. Furthermore,
  we outline the registry management<br> functions for maintaining models in the registry.'
