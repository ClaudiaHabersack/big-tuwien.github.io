abstract: We present the model checker MocOCL, a tool for model checking software
  models. The design rationale behind MocOCL is to close the gap between formal verification
  based on model checking and model-based engineering. Our approach avoids conversions
  that translate the software models into a format that a model checker can process.
  To this end, we implemented an explicit state model checker that directly processes
  the software model and verifies them against a specification formulated in a temporal
  extension of the constraint language OCL. MocOCL offers a web interface that interacts
  with the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
