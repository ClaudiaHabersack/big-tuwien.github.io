abstract: In a world of growing data streams, companies' identity management (IdM)
  gains ever more importance. Data should be easily accessible and capable of being
  integrated in existing and future business processes. Identities have to be authenticated
  inside a system on many occasions, sometimes by machines, sometimes by people. Therefore
  digital IDs are of equal importance as physical IDs. Although many universities
  employ smartcards, the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) still uses paper
  IDs and username/password combinations for digital authentication. Hence, a suitable
  authentication method for automated but localized applications, like door access
  security systems, is missing. Implementing new IDs, based on smartcard technology,
  could solve these problems. These smartcards should integrate with TU Vienna's information
  system called TISS and related processes should be guided to more mature levels
  as described by the concept of an Identity Management Architecture. In this work,
  student IDs, which are official photo IDs as well, are formally modeled as binding
  instruments. Requirements for new student IDs and their impact on TU Vienna's existing
  administrative processes are described. In this thesis a case study was conducted
  to take a closer look at the TU Vienna's identity management and to explore the
  ways it differs from usual corporate IdM. Autonomous organizational units, legal
  requirements and stakeholder are hindering factors when planning and implementing
  changes in TU Vienna's identity management. Identities at the TU Vienna are high
  in number and fluctuate intensely. Smooth transitions between the roles "student"
  and "employee" make IdM even more complex. Administrative processes are straight
  forward, but need to be flexible in special cases. Policies and documentation, as
  defined by the concept of identity management architecture (IMA), could assist in
  reducing complexity, facilitate communication between involved actors and, consequently,
  increase the probability of success of future IdM projects.
