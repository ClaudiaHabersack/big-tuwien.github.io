abstract: We present a 15-month descriptive case study on a real-world Scrum process
  transformation from a single-site to a distributed development environment in a
  medium-sized software development organization in Austria. The study describes what
  effects the scaling to a distributed development had on several key process indicators
  in one of the organization´s major projects. An action research approach has been
  selected to generate results from an in-depth and first-hand research setting. To
  increase objectivity and separation of concerns, a two-cycle approach, practitioner-oriented
  and research-oriented, has been established that aligns with sprint iterations.
  Many possible adaptations to the Scrum process have been tested over the course
  of the study. Key findings include that constant customer shipments after each sprint
  were a turning point in supporting the process of integrating the different sites
  in the distributed development environment and that the retrospective was an invaluable
  tool to keep frustration levels low in an ever-changing process environment.
