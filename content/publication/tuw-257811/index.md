abstract: Automated testing is an essential part of todays engineering projects. Rising
  complexity and growing size ask for more efficient instruments to assure quality.
  The automation of regression tests is in high demand but cannot be taken lightly.
  Especially in fast-moving agile projects, one needs a systematic approach to be
  successful in the long run. One promising approach is Model Based Testing (MBT).
  Although it is being actively researched and used for about 15 years, MBT gained
  adoption in only a few sectors, like automotive engineering and robotics. In contrast
  to this, the notion of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is rather young. In part
  because of its business-oriented principles it is widely used in enterprise application
  development. This thesis explores and compares multiple concepts and tools of model-based
  testing. The most promising ones were tested in an industrial case study in the
  area of financial software development. Finally a novel testing strategy, complementing
  existing quality assurance measures and combining the strengts of MBT and Behavior
  Driven Testing (BDT), is proposed. Results have shown that there are only a handful
  of MBT tools on the market, which are actively developed and used. One of them is
  Graphwalker, which is being developed as an open source project. Through its clear
  designated purpose and flexibility while using, it was a perfect fit for the case
  study project. The tool enables decoupling of logical and technical layers of the
  test cases, which promises substantial savings when it comes to maintenance. Furthermore
  a combination of model-based testing and behavior-driven testing is proposed. Used
  in the presented architecture, this hybrid approach ensures optimal coverage of
  branch logic and manually defined acceptance criteria.
