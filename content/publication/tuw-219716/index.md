abstract: Business Process Management (BPM) has gained significant adoption in practice
  for enabling organizations to increase their effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.
  This broad adoption has not only been fostered by a rich and wellestablished theory
  to model, analyze, simulate, and enact business processes, but also by internationally
  accepted standards and mature technologies. Caused by the ever increasing speed
  and volatility of markets and the dynamics of new technologies, such as cloud infrastructures
  and mobile communications, we face a new generation of business processes, which
  we refer to as living inter-organizational processes. Such processes are not in
  control of one single organization; instead, they are enacted by multiple organizations,
  where no participating party possesses full control over the entire process. Such
  processes often involve a high number of actors that might even be unknown in advance.
  These actors require various degrees in participation, they are acting in heterogeneous
  environments. Moreover, such processes are often weakly structured or designed in
  an ad-hoc manner, and have to be continuously subject to evolution. Unfortunately,
  existing theories, methodologies, and technologies cannot cope with this challenging
  combination of aspects, which all have to be considered when dealing with living
  inter-organizational processes. The state of the art typically addresses singular
  aspects in isolation. However, a holistic approach to these challenges bears a tremendous
  potential. This paper aims to contribute towards a holistic approach to living inter-organizational
  processes. To this end, we describe different perspectives on inter-organizational
  processes and identify challenges for making them living processes.
