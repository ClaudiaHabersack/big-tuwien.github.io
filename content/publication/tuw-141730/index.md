abstract: The United Nation´s Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business
  (UN/CEFACT) is a standardization body known for its work on UN/EDIFACT and ebXML.
  One of its most recent developments is UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology (UMM). The
  UMM standard is used to model inter-organizational business processes in the B2B
  domain. With the increasing availability of electronic governmental services over
  networks, the frontier between B2B and B2G/G2G disappears. Today one expects a governmental
  institution to react like any other business partner. Therefore also governments
  now face the interoperability and compatibility issues as regular businesses do.
  In order to allow two governmental institutions to collaborate, a methodology uniquely
  depicting the inter-organizational process from a global perspective is needed.
  In this paper we propose to use UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology in the eGovernment
  domain. UMM allows the definition of a global choreography which is then being used
  to derive local orchestrations for each business partner. Such orchestrations can
  then be used by enterprise applications in a service oriented context. As an example,
  a real-world scenario from the waste transport domain within the European Union
  will be shown. Furthermore the possible integration in the context of the We-Go
  project [3] is examined.
