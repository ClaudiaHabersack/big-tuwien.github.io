abstract: Within the project management community, the  concept of project management
  maturity models has recently  been receiving a lot of business and research attention.
  Although  the structure of most models has now been well defined and is  quite sophisticated,
  a lot of potential exists in extending the  currently described best practices that
  are part of these models  by additions for specific problem areas, such as working
  with  virtual (geographically distributed) teams.  This paper describes the challenges
  faced by those working  with virtual teams in the context of project management  maturity
  models, establishes a strategy how these models can be  extended to address these
  challenges, and identifies a set of best  practices for virtual team collaboration
  that can be integrated  into current maturity models.
