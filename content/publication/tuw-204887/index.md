abstract: Semantic technologies provide the means to create a  more ef&#64257;cient
  human-computer interaction. In this paper  we showcase how to use semantic technologies
  in the design  of a Document Management System (DMS) to re-engineer a  legacy DMS
  using a text-based search. Due to the historical  growth of the database, a text-based
  search without using  domain knowledge delivers bloated result-sets that prevent  an
  ef&#64257;cient use of the DMS. The requirement of an intel-  ligent search can
  be suitably addressed by using semantic  technologies, thus we propose such a new
  design of a DMS.  We employ concepts used in ontologies to provide search  results
  based on hierarchies that are based on concepts of  natural language. We construct
  a metamodel for the appli-  cation domain to deliver &#64257;tting suggestions along
  with the  search results. Finally, we realise a prototype as a proof-  of-concept
  based on the introduced design to highlight the  evident advantages of a semantic
  approach.
