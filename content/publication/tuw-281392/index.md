abstract: Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides tools and methods for the manipulation
  of formal models. In this letter, we leverage MDE for the transformation of production
  system models into flat files that are understood by general purpose planning tools
  and that enable the computation of "plans", i.e., sequences of production steps
  that are required to reach certain production goals. These plans are then merged
  back into the production system model, thus enriching the formalized production
  system knowledge.
