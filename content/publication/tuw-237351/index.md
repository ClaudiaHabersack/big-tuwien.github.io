abstract: The original REA accounting model (McCarthy, 1982) has been extended in
  previous years into a business modeling language. Apart from its conceptual model,
  academic effort has been put into the definition of a formal description language,
  based on standards such as UML or OWL. The specification of a generic data model
  from a software engineering point of view for domain independent use of REA for
  business model specification and execution has been touched only briefly in the
  past. Thus, we present a data model concept for runtime-configurable REA business
  model definition and execution.
