abstract: With recent advances in mobile technology, mobile devices have emerged from
  a luxury to a necessity in our daily lives. App development has been growing into
  a fast-paced market with volatile requirements. From a software developing point
  of view, responsive and adaptable software process models are advised to cope with
  such competitive markets. Over the last decade agile and lean methodologies have
  become very popular for software development in general, but there has only been
  limited research about the applicability of these methods in the area of mobile
  applications. This study aims to address the identified research gap and drafts
  a lean-agile process model that can compete with the requirements of today´s market.
  Our model ALP-mobile, an agile and lean process for mobile app development, combines
  elements of Scrum, Kanban and eXtreme Programming (XP). We drafted our model based
  on previous work and pilot interviews. We then presented it to multiple mobile-app-centric
  companies in Austria for an initial validation of strengths and weaknesses by industry
  experts. Our study shows large support and potential for our model among the interviewed
  experts calling for further increments and practical evaluation in future research.
