abstract: Music is not only a medium of entertainment but it also poses an important
  constituent in the development of a child since playing a musical instrument at
  an early age has a superior positive impact on cognitive development. This work
  dedicates itself to innovative Interfaces for music which belong to the research
  area of Tangible Computing. Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) are used as a link between
  user and digital process sequences. A variety of applications in the area of digital
  music production makes use of this technology. A focussed research of TUI-applications
  of innovative linkages for music should provide basic know-how. This will then be
  analysed and assessed with regard to re-application of individual modules. Additionally,
  pedagogic foundations of the meaning of music in child development as well as general
  ways of musical effectiveness will lead to a better understanding of this subject
  matter. The main focus of this work is on the construction of a prototype with which
  children at pre-school age using TUIs are able to play and record digital musical
  sequences. The goal was to develop an innovative Interface for music which combines
  some elements of already existing prototypes. A final evaluation provides insight
  into potential improvements; while the applied type of technology was well accepted
  by the circle of participants, the methods were partly received as too complex.
  Further results gathered as well as impressions ought to aid as a basis for follow-up
  projects.
