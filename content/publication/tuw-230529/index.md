abstract: 'Special Issue on A Roadmap for Business Informatics: In this special issue
  of the EMISA journal we include seven papers, each based on a IEEE CBI 2013 keynote
  introducing a research domain in Business Informatics. Evidently, these papers are
  neither classical research papers nor pure surveys, since they focus to a large
  extent on the "future", i.e. the open research challenges (without providing a solution).
  In the following, we define the scope of the seven research domains and in parentheses
  we name the author(s) who introduce( s) the domain by a paper presented in this
  special issue.'
