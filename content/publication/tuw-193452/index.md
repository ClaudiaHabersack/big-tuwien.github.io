abstract: The fast growth of social media is moving on and new records are continually
  published from the world of Facebook, Twitter & Co. The big success of several social
  media services leads to its strong use by the internet community to communicate,
  collaborate and interact in private and professional life. Many companies have already
  realized the high potential of the social web and are successfully applying such
  innovative services to achieve a higher efficiency by optimizing internal and external
  processes. Social web services are especially suited for marketing and communication
  activities as strong tool to interact with customers and other stakeholders. However,
  many companies havenÂ´t yet realized the extensive power of the web community. Thus,
  many marketing and communication campaigns failed right from the beginning or in
  the worst case even caused negative effects on them. This paper discusses different
  strategies how to use the social web for business and points out the potential pitfalls
  and risks based on representative case studies. The selected cases illustrate potential
  negative consequences like image damage or financial loss and the dynamics within
  the web community. Finally, crucial recommendations for companies are presented
  to avoid negative side-effects of modern marketing strategies.
