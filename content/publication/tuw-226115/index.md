abstract: Nowadays the focus of security specialists lies on securing the content
  of messages and on the identification of technical problems or vulnerabilities.
  Actual newspaper articles show that also traffic data and conceptual flaws can be
  vulnerabilities of computer systems. There are only a few publications which investigate
  this aspect explicitly. Therefore the focus of this thesis lies on the analysis
  of corporate communication components regarding traffic data and conceptual flaws.
  First of all potential attackers get analysed. Furthermore an overview of actual
  communication components is given. For further analysis, it is focused on email
  and voice over IP. These components are analysed regarding the used technologies
  and the processed data. Based on the results of these analyses, risks and threats
  regarding the communication components are determined. In the last step, a proper
  protection from the threats and risks is developed, in form of possible countermeasures.
  The analysis has shown that there are many possibilities for attackers to attack
  communication components. The waypoints on the transport route, data packets have
  to pass, provide good attacking possibilities. There are good security mechanisms
  for securing the transport route, but often such mechanisms aren´t used. Encryption
  mechanisms don´t always provide a proper protection, because attackers like the
  police and organized crime have their own ways to find out the key. Therefore it
  is important to analyse whether sensitive data should be stored and in which manner.
  The analysis has also shown, that traffic data can even reveal more information
  than content data and that not always technically high sophisticated attacks are
  necessary to gather valuable information. The result of the thesis is a list of
  the discovered risks and threats regarding traffic data and conceptional flaws of
  email and voice over IP. Furthermore the thesis compromises a list of possible countermeasures
  which provide a protection from the discovered risks and threats. These lists should
  be a compendium for companies to identify the listed risks and threats in their
  components and to implement the corresponding presented countermeasures.
