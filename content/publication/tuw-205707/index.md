abstract: Integrating patient synchronized applications (PSA) into hos-  pital information
  systems (HIS) is becoming an essential ob-  jective for improving high quality care
  by reducing the work  created by the recurring task of patient selection within
  vari-  ous clinical and administrative applications. The introduced  architecture
  is based on IHE´s PSA pro&#64257;le which it extends  with a conferencing feature.
  As part of such a conference,  clients in the same context can message each other,
  share  information, send work&#64258;ow information, and perform dis-  tributed
  diagnosis on patient records. The architecture was  then implemented in a prototype
  HIS for evaluating the tech-  nical feasibility and potential work&#64258;ow enhancements.
