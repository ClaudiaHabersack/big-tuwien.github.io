abstract: The common use and variety of social software services has rapidly increased
  over the past years. The big success of established services like Facebook, Twitter
  or YouTube accelerates the transformation of the whole web. Next generation services
  are characterized by strong social interaction and collaboration tools. Significantly
  affected by this movement, conventional commerce platforms and online shops are
  gradually substituted by social shopping communities. Social commerce allows consumers
  to collaborate online, to exchange information about products and to get advice
  from trusted individuals. This paper introduces a scalable social software service
  model for an online shopping community built under consideration of existing best
  practice services. The model combines features of social networking, online shopping
  and social commerce sites. We present comparative analyses of these three service
  categories, significant showcases as well as the creation process of the model itself.
  The designed framework serves as basis for both service developers and researchers.
