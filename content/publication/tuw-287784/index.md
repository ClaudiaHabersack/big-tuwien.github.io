abstract: Although initially designed for co-located teams, agile methodologies promise
  mitigation to the challenges present in distributed software development with their
  demand for frequent communication. We examine the application of agile practices
  in software engineering teams with low geographical distribution in Austria and
  Germany. To gather insights on challenges and benefits faced by distributed teams
  we conduct interviews with eleven representatives and analyse the interview transcripts
  using the inductive category formation method. As a result, we identify four major
  challenges, such as technical obstructions or the impediments different language
  abilities have on communication, and four benefits, regarding collaboration and
  information radiation, that agile methods yield in distributed teams. Based on our
  analysis of challenges and benefits, we deduct seven recommendations to improve
  collaboration, overcome distance and avoid pitfalls. Key recommendations for teams
  with low geographical distance include that teams should get together at certain
  points to build relationships and trust and share information face-toface.
