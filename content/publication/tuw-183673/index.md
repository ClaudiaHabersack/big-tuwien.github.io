abstract: Software testing is a part of the software development process. It is a
  challenging task and testing Web-based applications may be even more difficult,
  due to the peculiarities of such applications. New technologies in internet applications
  require adaptations of most test frameworks. A very popular technology which is
  widely used from many well known internet services is called AJAX. AJAX stands for
  "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" and is a combination of many known technologies,
  which allow asynchronous data communication between server and client. In contrast
  to the standard synchronous data communication, which means loading an entire web
  page after each request, AJAX allows dynamic refreshes of the web page and data
  exchange of parts of the page. Thus testing of such internet applications is different
  from testing of "normal" applications because there can be interactions with the
  server without the need to load a new page. Communication is done in the background
  and the current page stays the same except of minor changes. This paper gives an
  overview of the basic principles of automated software tests, especially automated
  testing of web based applications. Furthermore it shows the influence of AJAX concerning
  web development and testing of web applications. The main issue of this paper is
  to extend HtmlUnit for test automation of web applications using AJAX. Based on
  the used concepts it is possible to extend further test frameworks. HtmlUnit is
  a test framework for internet applications. It simulates a web browser and provides
  many functions to check the content of a web page. HtmlUnit doesnÂ´t have a graphical
  user interface but it is written in the programming language Java. Test cases are
  written using JUnit tests but like many other test frameworks HtmlUnit has some
  problems testing AJAX enabled internet applications.
