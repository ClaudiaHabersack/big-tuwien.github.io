abstract: Gamification of online surveys has been shown to be effective for improving
  user experience and data quality. However, the precise effects of isolated game
  elements is unknown and survey gamification requires a lot of effort. This work
  proposes the use of just a single game element as a novel low-cost approach. It
  presents evaluation results from a case study where an existing survey was gamified
  using the popular game element of achievement badges. Results show that the badges
  improved the user experience but did not influence the respondents' behavior. These
  benefits are similar to related work but have been achieved with a lower effort.
  In summary, the case study indicates our low-cost approach to be viable and efficient
  for survey gamification, and achievement badges to be well-suited for gamified online
  surveys.
