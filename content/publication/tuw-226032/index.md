abstract: This publication describes the analysis and development of a serious game
  for the rehabilitation of stroke patients, which was conducted with the assistance
  of an experienced physiotherapist using a user-centered design. After a stroke,
  patients often complain about balance related problems or partial paralysis. Normal
  rehabilitation training depends on balance and strength exercises. In such cases
  balance plates are often used as training devices, but patients often report lack
  of motivation especially when training at home. The research objective of this publication
  was to develop a serious game using the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board. From a physiotherapeutic
  view it should help patients suffering from a stroke throughout their rehabilitation,
  especially to increase the motivation to do their exercises. Since every patient
  is different, the developed serious game can be customized by a physiotherapist
  for the individual patient's needs. A lot of customization options provide optimal
  support for the entire rehabilitation process.
