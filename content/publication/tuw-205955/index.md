abstract: Due to a preceding interconnectedness of various health providers as well
  as the intended  comprehensive implementation of an electronic health record (EHR)
  in Austria, issues of data  management and data security of especially sensitive
  (medical) data are becoming more and  more important. The given paper´s goal, on
  the one hand, is the improvement of secure data  management and data processing
  of exceptionally sensitive (medical) data in a e-health data  center. This is done
  via exemplary paradigms of a catalog of requirements in which the  operations to
  be conducted in case of security problems will be processed in a graphic as well  as
  written form. On the other hand this paper aims at sensitizing the reader for the
  issue of  medical data security. To give an overview of the current state of data
  security regulations in  Austria, relevant legal texts used for the processing of
  especially sensitive data will be  depicted as well as exemplified. Through the
  depiction and presentation of protection goals,  the illustration of an information
  security management system (ISMS) process, including a  brief exemplification of
  steps conducted in ISMS as well as depictions of various IT  documentations, the
  reader will be presented with the concept, the implementation and  realization of
  essential modules contained in the catalog of requirements conceptualized in  this
  paper.
