abstract: This paper presents standards and technologies of Automatic Fare Collection
  (AFC) systems. Dif- ferent approaches in combining public transportation tickets
  with tickets for leisure activities are presented based on scientific literature
  as well as data security and the developement of security measures. A concept was
  developed to combine tickets for pubilc transportation and leisure activities on
  one smart card. This concept is based on CiPurse, an open standard from the Open
  Standards for Public Transportation Alliance (OSPT Alliance). CiPurse provides high
  security measurements and interoperability and wants to give public transportation
  companies the opportunity to switch to an open system by its modular design. At
  first the requirements for AFC are raised based on the current State-of-the-Art.
  The presented concept was evaluated with an implemented prototype. This prototype
  offers of a combination of public transportation and leisure activity tickets based
  on open source. CiPurse was compared to the established, proprietary solutions MiFare
  and FeliCa. Besides an evaluation of the feasibility and the requirements for an
  AFC system CiPurse was compared to established, proprietary solutions Mifare and
  FeliCa. A special focus is on security measures, where Cipurse offers a 128 Bit
  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and countermeasures for side channel
  attacks. This thesis shows as a result that the developed concept can be implemented
  based on CiPurse. Although the prototype for Vienna has some limitations, the security
  measures for CiPurse have been complied with. A requirement analysis shows especially
  in this area the differences between CiPurse, MiFare, and FeliCa. The advantages
  of all AFC systems are lower operating costs compared to paper tickets.
