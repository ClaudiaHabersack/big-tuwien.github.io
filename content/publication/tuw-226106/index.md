abstract: 'This work presents a prototype for an interactive, multi-touch restaurant
  table which allows guests to interactively share their expenses. Current payment
  processes are cumbersome, time intensive, error prone, and do not support collaboration
  between guests: first, a waiter has to be informed that the guest wants to pay.
  This is followed by one guest after the other telling this waiter which products
  have been consumed. To improve the situation, this work proposes to use restaurant
  tables with an interactive multi-touch surface. The user interface of these tables
  allows guests to place orders and pay for food. Methodologically, usability engineering
  methods like field studies, user interface design, and prototyping were used to
  create a prototype. This prototype emphasizes the experience of sharing meals and
  expenses and enables fast payments for the consumed goods. Usability evaluation
  shows that the proposed approach is positively received by users and they think
  of the system as beeing innovative and entertaining. Test persons also conceived
  deployment in a real life restaurant environment as very desirable.'
