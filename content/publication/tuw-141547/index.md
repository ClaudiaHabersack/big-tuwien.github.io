abstract: Previous work already investigated the value of ambient sound visualizations
  for deaf and hearing-impaired people. Our work builds upon these results and specifically
  explores the applicability of the ceiling for such visualizations. Thus, we gathered
  design requirements based on a participatory design process including expert interviews,
  an online questionnaire as well as a design workshop at a local organization for
  deaf people. Results from the workshop showed that people highly approved the idea
  to use the ceiling for ambient visualizations. However, they also expressed a strong
  need for a supplementary traditional display to get more detailed information about
  occurring sounds. The implications that we derived in the present study build the
  basis for a prototype that we currently develop at our research group.
