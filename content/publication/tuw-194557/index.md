abstract: The advent of information technology has led to a growth of available information
  and consequently to the necessity of developing appropriate ways of information
  representation. The current trend of using social networking sites among others
  to publish personal data indicates the users' desire for self-expression. Furthermore
  miniaturisation of hardware enabled mobile computers and subsequently wearable computing
  and furthermore wearable visualisation has evolved. Inspired by these evolving directions
  previous research has led to a wearable, publicly viewable device, which combines
  physical information visualisation with sonification to represent data about the
  user's activity and environment. For aesthetic and privacy concerns fabric folding
  was chosen as the physical visualisation method and abstract sounds were used for
  sonification. The goal of this thesis project is to finish a second-iteration prototype
  for this device and to evaluate this prototype. To verify the value of this device
  a user evaluation study was designed to indicate the directions for further developments
  in this domain of information representation. As the device is a novel development
  in this field of research a new evaluation methodology based on common methods and
  measurements was modelled. The main research result revealed folding and sonification
  are able to fulfil the designers' intentions of creating a useful and comprehensible
  wearable display. The method to realise the folds needs to be improved, to increase
  the value of the folding and sonifying device.
