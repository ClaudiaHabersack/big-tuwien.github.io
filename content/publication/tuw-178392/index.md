abstract: The electronic exchange of business documents is an often communicated desire
  by enterprises and the public sector. Electronic business is currently mainly hindered
  by unresolved interoperability issues and a lack of tool support. Additionally,
  computer aided document exchange is cost intensive at the beginning and thus discourages
  small and medium-sized companies to adapt to new technologies. The contribution
  of this paper is to present suitable tool support and methods to manage the complexity
  of business document integration. Our modeling tool is based on UN/CEFACT's (United
  Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business) Core Components Technical
  Specification allowing for platform independent, conceptual business document models.
  On these models further integration operations can be performed.
