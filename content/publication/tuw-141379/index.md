abstract: 'Over the last decade more and more companies started to optimize their
  business processes in a way to meet its business goals. They develop business process
  models defining which activities have to be executed in which order under which
  conditions by whom and by using which resources. For this purpose a lot of different
  approaches to business process modelling have been developed, which resulted in
  many different Business Process Modelling Languages (BPMLs).   The definition of
  a business process has to cover many different aspects (e.g. control flow, organizational
  view, data view, etc.). A perfect business process modelling approach would address
  all the different aspects. Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches provides
  concepts for addressing all of these aspects. Each of them concentrates on some
  aspects. The focus on certain aspects is mainly due to the different applications
  areas, e.g. business engineering or software engineering etc.   Although BPMLs are
  well established in industry and science, a comprehensive evaluation or a framework
  for an evaluation to compare the different BPMLs is still missing. Thus, it is the
  goal of this thesis to provide an evaluation framework for the comparison of BPMLs
  and to apply this framework in the evaluation of the currently most popular BPMLs.
  The resulting framework is based on a generic metamodel that captures all of the
  concepts appearing in any of the state-of-the-art BPMLs. On a high level this framework
  addresses the following views: Business Process Context Perspective, Behavioural
  Perspective, Functional Perspective, Informational Perspective, and Organisational
  Perspective. An evaluation based on this framework checks whether the certain aspects
  in each of these perspectives is supported by the concepts of each of the considered
  BPMLs. In the evaluation of this thesis, we used the following languages: UML 2
  Activity Diagram, Business Process Modelling Notation, Event Driven Process Chain,
  IDEF3, Petri Net, Role Activity Diagram.   According to the evaluation we were able
  to identify three main problems in current BPMLs. The first problem is that the
  definition of the dependency between business processes and their supporting software
  systems is inadequately supported. In our approach we support the elicitation of
  requirements from business process models for the software systems to be developed
  by extending current BPMLs with software requirements and components to ensure a
  business-goal oriented software development.   The second problem concerns the variability
  of similar, but well-distinguished software products within a software product line.
  These software products not only differ in its structural definition, but also in
  the process to create them. Today, variability modelling is a domain specific modelling
  technique that is limited to the structural definition of similar software products.
  In our approach we extend the concepts of variability modeling to integrate the
  dynamical aspects into the UML. The resulting approach is based on a well defined
  dependency between UML class diagrams and UML activity diagrams.   The third problem
  is that current conceptual BPMLs do not provide explicit modelling means for process
  goals and their measures. The modelling of goals and its monitoring is a critical
  step in business process modeling. Hence, we extend the metamodels of UML 2 AD,
  EPC and BPMN with business process goals and performance measures. These concepts
  become explicitly visible in the corresponding models. Furthermore, a mapping of
  the performance measures onto the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) enables
  their monitoring in an execution environment.'
