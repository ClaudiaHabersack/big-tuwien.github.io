abstract: As part of Facility Management (FM), properties, buildings, floors, spaces,
  equipment, devices, machinery and people are administered, and their cost-relevant
  processes are optimized. To implement FM efficiently, Information Technology (IT)
  is necessary, specifically Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM) systems. At
  many universities a high potential for optimization exists around FM, whereby the
  demand for CAFM software products has increased considerably. This need was the
  impetus and motivation for this thesis. The two main goals of this thesis were,
  on the one hand, to take stock of the use of CAFM systems at German and Austrian
  universities with a focus on room and floor-space management. And, on the other
  hand, to create a catalog of criteria for the selection of CAFM software products
  for this sector. As a result of an in-depth literature review, it was possible to
  find fundamentally important CAFM basic criteria as well as university domain-specific
  criteria. Based on this, both freely available open-source and commercial CAFM solutions
  were analyzed and evaluated. It turned out that established CAFM software met the
  criteria sufficiently, while open-source solutions were inappropriate for professional
  use at a German or Austrian university. An extensive empirical investigation was
  conducted among Facility Managers in the university environment. The data obtained
  were first aggregated by means of qualitative topic analysis and then quantitatively
  evaluated using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings were used,
  among other things, to take stock of CAFM. As a result of the literature research,
  the product analysis and the empirical survey, a CAFM criteria catalog was finally
  developed. Using methodology presented for categorization and prioritization of
  requirements, Facility Managers of German and Austrian universities can use the
  hereby developed criteria catalog to identify the most suitable CAFM software solution
  for the respective university.
