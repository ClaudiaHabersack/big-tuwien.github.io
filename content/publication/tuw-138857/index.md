abstract: 'Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated
  visualization and analysis of normal and diseased blood vessels. The objective of
  this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged
  by computed tomography (CT). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical
  structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The
  model separates two homogeneous regions: Its inner side represents a region of density
  for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the
  point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian
  kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for
  vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter
  optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure (the Levenberg-Marquardt technique).
  The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well
  as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data
  and real patient data with encouraging results.'
