abstract: Since March, 15th 2009 it is obligatory for every Member Country of the
  European Union to implement the European Data Retention Directive 2006/24/EC into
  national legislation. This Directive is about the retention of data generated or
  processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications
  services or of public communications networks. This paper takes a closer look at
  the Austrian approach to enforce this Directive. The Austrian implementation has
  been delayed by nearly 3 years and has brought the corresponding national regulations
  into force with April, 1st 2012. The major concern was to design and implement a
  legal and technical system within the conditions given by the Directive, but guaranteeing
  a maximum protection of the Austrian citizens´ personal data and privacy. Therefore
  it allows a centrally managed access in conformity with the law to necessary retention
  data for corresponding responsible authorities. One of the core aspects to ensure
  citizens privacy is the fact that all retention data may only be stored by the respective
  telecommunication providers and authorities have to request required data only in
  entitled cases. Access to retention data has to comply to regulations of the four-eye
  principle and conforming logging has to be carried out, as well as further authorities
  must be notified about such a data request. Any communication between the enumerated
  actors has to be performed via a specifically constructed communication system,
  called DLS. The DLS is implemented in a way to ensure confidentiality, authenticity,
  integrity and non-repudiation for all requests and responses as well as to carry
  out legally required notifications. Therefore, this system on the one hand implements
  high confidential encryption and authentication techniques and on the other hand
  automatically performs all the required notifications and logging, all without being
  able to have insight to the transmitted sensitive data. The article gives a comprehensive
  overview about the whole system designed to implement the Data Retention Directive
  regarding both the legal environment and the corresponding technical implementation.
  Moreover should be shown how this system is able to ensure that data accesses to
  retention data only happen in conformity with the law and breaches of citizens´
  privacy could be prevented.
