abstract: The German working committee for "Industrie 4.0" identified the horizontal
  integration throughout value networks and the vertical integration of networked
  manufacturing systems as key issues in the context of smart factories. For this
  purpose we aim for a universal model-driven industrial engineering framework spanning
  over production chains and value networks. Thereby, we build up on the Resource
  Event Agent (REA) business ontology (ISO/IEC 15944-4) to describe external activities
  requiring horizontal integration with business partners and internal activities
  serving for vertical integration within a manufacturing enterprise. We plan to apply
  the ISA-95 industry standard (ANSI/ISA-95; DIN EN 62264) to describe the vertical
  integration within an enterprise and its decentralized, networked production plants.
  As a first step, presented in this paper, we extend the REA ontology by useful concepts
  known from ISA-95 towards an integrating modeling framework.
