abstract: The increasing technologization of the business world yields many benefits.
  Documents are avail- able anywhere and at any time, and messages in the form of
  emails can be sent across the globe in a matter of seconds. Simply put, various
  kinds of information are - in digital form - just accessible. However, providing
  information requires storage space, and through the ever growing amount of digital
  information, the demand for additional storage space increases as well. Careless
  use of the data further adds to the problem, for example, sending mass emails with
  videos or presenta- tions. The resulting need to cope with the continuously increasing
  demand for capacity is posing a considerable challenge for the information technology
  (IT) departments of organizations. Because of the large number of involved systems
  and storage locations, keeping an overview of the overall consumption is hard. This
  problem concerns end users, which therefore lack the ability of watching their space
  usage. Administrators are impeded by the lack of overview of the current situation
  and the consumption evolution as well. Further, capacity planning, charging user
  departments for consumed IT services, and justifying budget for new hardware against
  the executive management become more difficult. This thesis tries to address these
  problems. In a literature research the management of data throughout its life cycle
  will be examined in the form of Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) and email
  archiving. Further, two governance models, the Information Technology Infrastructure
  Library (ITIL) and the Control Objectives for IT and Related Technologies (COBIT),
  will be ex- plored with regard to their utilization of monitoring and reporting.
  Requirements will be derived from each of the topics of the literature research
  and complemented with experiences from a sam- ple domain. Afterwards, a prototype
  will be implemented according to and validated against the found requirements. The
  developed prototype constitutes a modular system to monitor and record resource
  consump- tion. It can be extended extensively by configuration, the installation
  of new components and by implementing additional monitoring modules. The prototype
  integrates seamlessly into existing infrastructures, for example by providing the
  ability to interface with existing directory services and authentication mechanisms.
  The reporting component provides the end users with person- alized reports of their
  resource consumption. For the use by managers, administrators and other parties
  in charge of IT, the data can be summarized by users and departments or the whole
  orga- nization. Like the monitoring system, this component can be extended by additional
  modules and configured by an administration website.
