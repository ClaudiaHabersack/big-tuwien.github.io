### Topic

Model-Based Adaptation Engineering (MAE) in Automation Systems Engineering (ASE) (MAE4ASE) is a module of the Christian Doppler Laboratory on Software Engineering Integration for Flexible Automation Systems. It addresses the upcoming need of ASE to raise the level of flexibility of automation systems even further in order to better react to changing environments. For instance, this is of particular importance in the context of the emerging Industry 4.0 initiative which aims, amongst other goals, at providing increased flexibility for production systems to better adapt to the changing needs of customers, organizations, and society. As a consequence, systems are no longer designed to be, but they have to be designed to evolve. Of course, raising the level of flexibility by switching to evolvable systems directly impacts the requirements on and complexity of the engineering process for such systems. To cope with this new kind complexity in ASE, dedicated concepts, techniques, and tools are needed to enable change and to ensure a systematic, safe, and predictable adaptation of systems to prevent the negative side effects of ad-hoc changes. A promising way to tackle this problem is to apply modeling and simulation approaches in combination with the establishment of adaptations as first class entities throughout the whole engineering process which is the mission of MAE4ASE.
