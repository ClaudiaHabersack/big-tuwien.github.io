abstract: Inter-organizational systems have significantly been affected by Service-oriented
  Architectures (SOA) andWeb Services - the state-of-the-art technology to implement
  SOA. SOA is said to enable quick and inexpensive changes of the IT in order to establish
  new business partnerships or to reflect changes in existing partnerships. However,
  current approaches to inter-organizational systems focus too much on existing Web
  Services standards and, thus, on the technology layer. In such an approach the technology
  drives the business. In this paper we analyze the shortcomings of this bottom-up
  approach. As an alternative we suggest a top-down methodology where the business
  requirements drive the technology. This methodology starts off with the business
  value perspective, leading to a business process perspective and resulting in an
  IT execution perspective. We do not invent any new approaches on each of these layers,
  rather we outline how existing approaches are used and combined into a business
  requirements driven approach to inter-organizational systems.
