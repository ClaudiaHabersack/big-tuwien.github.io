abstract: In the last decade smart phones became more and more important. One of the
  reasons for their great popularity is the fact that apps offer a wide range of additional
  features from productivity tools to games. Mobile apps are usually developed with
  software development kits (SDKs) provided by the specific platform provider. Apps
  that have been developed with such SDKs are named native apps. Alternatives to native
  apps have been developed in the past few years. Web apps are one such alternative
  because they also provide most of the functionality of native apps. Another architectural
  alternative would be the encapsulation of such a web app in a native web container.
  This allows the app to be distributed through a common market place for example.
  Such apps are called hybrid apps. Which of these alternatives should be used for
  a given project is a question that needs to be answered rather early in a software
  project. Since architectural design decisions are crucial for the project´s success,
  it makes sense to support this decision with a methodical process like decision
  techniques do. Since there are several decision techniques, it is also necessary
  to find an appropriate one. The selection of a technique could be done with the
  process suggested by Falessi et al. [12]. This process and the implementation of
  a relevant case study is, together with the theoretical basics, matter of this document.
  Therefore it provides a method for selecting an architecture option (nativ, hybrid,
  web) for mobile applications.
