abstract: Resource-Event-Agent (REA) has been applied to various engineering and business
  domains, with a focus on transfer activities rather than transformation activities.
  In the context of smart manufacturing, vertical integration of IT systems (e.g.,
  business applications and production control systems) is a key factor. In this work,
  we shed light on the integration of REA concepts into production environments by
  investigating properties of REA transformations and aligning them with concepts
  from an international standard for enterprise-control system integration (ISA-95).
