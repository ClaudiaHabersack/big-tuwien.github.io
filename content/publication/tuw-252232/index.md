abstract: Business documents directly exchanged between<br> applications usually follow
  a certain business<br> document standard. No matter whether these standards are<br>
  traditional EDI standards or XML-based, they are very<br> generic including all
  elements that may be of need to any<br> company in this world. Before being used
  in a partnership,<br> a subset of these elements has to be defined based on the<br>
  business context (geopolitical region, industry, etc.). Usually<br> the definition
  of these subsets-called Message Implementation<br> Guidelines-starts from scratch,
  and, thus, is<br> very time-consuming. In this paper we present an approach<br>
  to explicitly assign context to the definition of Message<br> Implementation Guidelines.
  This contextual information is<br> also used to calculate a subset for to-be-developed
  Message<br> Implementation Guidelines based on existing ones. The<br> corresponding
  approach is supported by a prototype<br> implementation.
