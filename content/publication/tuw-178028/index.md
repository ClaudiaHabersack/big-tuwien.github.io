abstract: Approximately 1000 students of computer science and business<br> informatics
  attend the course Introduction to Object-<br> Oriented Modeling (OOM) offered by
  the Business Informatics<br> Group (BIG) of the Vienna University of Technology<br>
  each year in order to learn the basic concepts of the Unified<br> Modeling Language
  (UML) and to obtain a certificate.<br> For finishing the course successfully, the
  students must pass<br> three small tests where they have to prove their theoretical<br>
  knowledge about UML concepts as well as their ability to<br> apply this knowledge
  in practical exercises. In this paper we<br> report our experiences in assessing
  the modeling knowledge<br> of our students and we reveal how we design the tests.
