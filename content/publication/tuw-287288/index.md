abstract: 'The usability degree of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) might deteriorate
  after a design change, and detecting this quality loss quickly can be challenging.
  Automating heuristic-based usability inspection even partially could reduce the
  efforts required for sustaining an appropriate level of usability. On the other
  hand, GUI testing is a field highly conversant with automation. The purpose of this
  study is to show that even though GUI testing and usability testing are two distinct
  fields, they might influence each other. It is theorized that the automation of
  heuristic evaluation can be greatly improved thanks to GUI event sequencing, a test
  automation technique. To that end, an existing heuristic set is selected and tailored
  to fit the context of Windows desktop applications. The derived set is then analysed
  in accordance with the feasibility of its automation. The examined guidelines are
  classified into three categories: Those suitable for automation with GUI event sequencing,
  those that can be verified automatically without sequencing events, and those appropriate
  for manual testing. Then, a sample of heuristics from the first category is evaluated
  in a GUI testing tool to validate the feasibility of their automation in practice.
  The results showed that 55% of the heuristics could be tested automatically with
  event sequencing, and that 75% of them could be automated in general. This indicates
  a potential to greatly decrease the manual work of the usability evaluator. Moreover,
  a pattern was noted among guidelines from the first category. Their evaluation requires
  at least one user-system interaction and does not focus on attributes uncatchable
  by GUI testing tools such as the aesthetic value. These results imply that a heuristic
  set can be arranged in advance so it consists only of guidelines suitable for automation.'
