abstract: Agile methodologies are facing increased adoption in software engineering
  teams. Established practices like Scrum or extreme programming furthermore strongly
  suggest to co-locate all team members in one office. Simultaneously there is a rising
  trend of remote working and distributed teams in today&iquest;s software development
  community. Despite this alleged contradiction there is an increasing number of distributed
  teams applying agile methods. This thesis examines how agile process models can
  be applied in distributed teams, which challenges have to be faced and which benefits
  such process models can entail. To delimit the scope this thesis focuses on teams
  with a limited spatial dispersion, explicitly investigating teams that are distributed
  within one or at most across neighboring countries. In order to achieve that the
  author performed a case study analyzing multiple distributed teams located in Austria
  or Germany. Data collection was done through semi-structured interviews of team
  leaders and experts who have practical experience in this area. The content analysis
  clearly indicates that applying agile methods in distributed teams with low spatial
  distance poses no problem but instead even brings forth several benefits. Modern
  technology enables teams to communicate remotely without serious obstacles and allow
  a close collaboration across geographical locations. Teams successfully mastered
  common agile practices and methods like short iterations, pair programming, daily
  meetings, code reviews or retrospective meetings in their distributed settings which
  not only improve the software engineering process but furthermore pose important
  communication channels which strengthen the team. Frequent informal as well as formal
  communication, short iteration cycles and regular face-to-face contact help to overcome
  problems of distributed collaboration especially when it comes to the problem areas
  of coordination and control. As a result this thesis brings up six challenges as
  well as five benefits of agile methods in distributed teams. Conclusively eleven
  recommendations derived from the analyzed data are presented which aim at improving
  the application of agile methods in such environments.
