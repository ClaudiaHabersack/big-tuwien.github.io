abstract: The Austrian ELAK system has been developed as a result of different e-government
  initiatives and is the administrative system of the Austrian Government. The document-ed
  requirements for the ELAK system are older than ten years. Due to technological
  and organizational changes, an adopted requirement analysis should be carried out
  to inte-grate these changes into further developments of the ELAK system. In this
  paper a new requirement analysis is carried out to document the requirements for
  an ELAK system. This is based on the literature of the Austrian General Administrative
  Procedures Act, the E-Government Act, the office rules and the technical specifications
  for the current ELAK system. The present study has not analyzed the current ELAK
  system but rather one from scratch. So it isn't influenced by the current ELAK system
  which is already being used by the Austrian ministries of the Federal Government.
  For the EU dimension the administrative system of the German Government and the
  Swiss Government has been used to derive new requirements. These requirements are
  also part of this work. For this work requirements were gained for the government
  processes of receiving, processing, execution, dispatch and distribution, electronic
  archive, infra-structure and administration. Moreover, it is shown how the structural
  and procedural organization can be modeled in the software system for electronic
  files. Additionally the didactic part of this work describes how training for the
  launch of the software system for electronic files should be prepared.
