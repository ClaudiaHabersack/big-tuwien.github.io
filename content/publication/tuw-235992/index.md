abstract: This publication describes the analysis and development of an application
  for Borderline Personality Disorder patients, which was conducted with the assistance
  of 18 psychological experts from three different countries and resulted in a functional
  prototype containing those requirements. Nonsuicidal self-injury means deliberately
  harming one´s own body tissue without suicidal intent and is associated with Borderline
  Personality Disorder. The research objective was to identify basic requirements
  to help those people with the support of a mobile device. Due to the lack of available
  mobile applications to support both patients and therapists, the novel prototype
  unCUT was developed and evaluated with those psychological experts throughout different
  iterations which ended up in 14 identified basic requirements for such an application.
