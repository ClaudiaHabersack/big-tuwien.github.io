abstract: The measurement of the knowledge change of employees as well as the subsequent
  transfer<br> within their companies is discussed in this thesis. Although these
  two terms are often used<br> synonymously, there is a clear difference between them.
  Learning is adapting to a situation<br> whereas transfer is applying this knowledge
  to similar situations.<br> There are various approaches to measuring learning success
  or transfer, most of which originate<br> in educational science. In this thesis
  we consider the special case of innovation courses,<br> where there are various
  additional requirements that must be met for the measurement. Unfortunately,<br>
  the existing frameworks are not designed for these requirements and are therefore
  not<br> sufficient.<br> An innovation course is a long-term course in which employees
  of various companies are<br> taught and trained in a certain topic. Such an innovation
  course consists of several modules<br> for which both the measurement of learning
  success and knowledge transfer for the individual<br> participants must take place
  in the various modules. To achieve this and to make the measurements<br> repeatable
  and objective, we have developed a framework for transfer monitoring from<br> university
  to industry.<br> We use the Design Science Approach to develop the framework. However,
  the goal is not to<br> create a static artefact that can only be applied to the
  course of our case study, but to design a<br> framework that is also easily adaptable
  and applicable in other innovation courses or in a similar<br> environment. To test
  and improve this framework, we use it in four modules of the DigiTrans<br> 4.0 innovation
  course.<br> For three of the four modules of our case study, the difference between
  the knowledge before<br> the module and at the end is statistically significant.
  We also create linear models to explain or<br> predict the transfer. The necessary
  variables for linear regressions are derived from literature<br> research. The models
  are created both with and without heteroscedasticity adjustment. The<br> results
  of the models are slightly different, but show a common trend, which originates
  from the<br> same background formula. Since these characteristics are known in the
  literature of knowledge<br> transfer, the framework created is well suited for measuring
  the transfer.
