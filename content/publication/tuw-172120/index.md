abstract: Quality assurance plays a central role in the manufacturing industry. Many
  companies have accumulated solutions in this area, which have been growing historically.
  These solutions are usually not competitive and "state of the art" any more. In
  order to stay competitive, these solutions have to be revised. The goal of this
  work is to point out how to identify and classify legacy systems, and how to implement
  a modernization strategy, which assures an optimal solution for the company. After
  giving a general overview of the basic principles of quality assurance, a concrete
  example is depicted in great detail. In this example it will be analyzed which actions
  need to be taken in order to modernize and optimize the existing software based
  quality assurance system. Scenario based decision making and reverse engineering
  is used to make a comparative analysis, which shows the advantages and disadvantages
  of the different possible strategies.
