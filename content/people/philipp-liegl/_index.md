I studied Business Informatics at Vienna University of Technology where I received my master’s degree and my PhD. From 2006 until the end of 2007 I worked as a researcher at the Research Studios Austria. In 2008 I joined the Business Informatics Group’s team to work on various research projects including <a href="http://www.bsopt.at/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BSopt</a> (Business Semantics on top of Process Technology) and <a href="http://www.erpel.at" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ERPEL</a> (E-Business Registry Permitting Enterprise Liaisons).

My research focuses on aspects of inter-organizational communication such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), inter-organizational business process modeling, business document modeling, and service-oriented architectures. Currently, I am working on topics related to the computerization of manufacturing and retail – in particular in regard to procurement and distribution automation.

Furthermore, I am interested in Web application development and its related technologies.

In 2011 I joined the team of [ecosio GmbH](https://ecosio.com/), a company providing EDI solutions for companies of any size. Nevertheless, you may still find me at the university from time to time, holding lectures for the Business Informatics Group.
