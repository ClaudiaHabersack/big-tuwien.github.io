abstract: The tighter coupling of enterprises in regard to information system technology<br>
  has also changed the way business processes are modeled. Modeling interorganizational<br>
  business processes is necessary in order to gain a profound and<br> unique representation
  of the processes involved. However this requires a new<br> methodology especially
  designed for modeling inter-organizational business processes.<br> The United Nation´s
  Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business<br> (UN/CEFACT) took up the
  challenge and started to develop such a methodology.<br> The research efforts became
  known as UN/CEFACT´s modeling methodology<br> (UMM) [1]. UMM enables the business
  modeler to capture the business<br> knowledge independent of the underlying implementation
  technology such as<br> ebXML or Web Services.<br> Due to the popularity of the Unified
  Modeling Language (UML) the UMM is<br> built on top of it. UMM is defined as a UML
  profile - i.e. a set of stereotypes,<br> tagged values and constraints - in order
  to customize the UML meta model for<br> the specific purpose of modeling the collaborative
  space in B2B.<br> Although the standard is well developed and documented, its complexity
  and<br> mightiness make it difficult for the novice user to perceive from scratch.
  Therefore<br> a tool, supporting themodeler in creating a validUMMmodel would help
  those inexperienced<br> with UMM.We have developed such a plug-in for the UML modeling<br>
  tool Enterprise Architect 1 called UMM Add-In 2.We highlight the main features<br>
  of the Add-In and show how the tool facilitates the use of the methodology.
