abstract: 'This thesis covers the subject of Network Discovery - finding devices in
  a computer network, as well as information about them and their connections. Network
  Discovery is a part of the more general area of Network Management and can serve
  as the basis for many tasks in this field. This thesis does not only highlight the
  practical relevance of the subject, but also provides an introduction to a whole
  range of related topics. It also covers specific discovery methods in detail. Some
  of the presented techniques are selected and integrated into a single discovery
  algorithm. A core aspect of this algorithm is a discovery with minimum previous
  knowledge (i.e. as little information as possible about the network is necessary).
  This algorithm is then implemented in a program called Network Explorer, which has
  been developed as part of this thesis. The program is employed in an actual corporate
  network and its results are presented, analyzed, and evaluated. Furthermore, examples
  and scenarios for the use of this program are addressed. The main goals of this
  thesis are: to provide an introduction to this subject; to list, explain, and compare
  concrete discovery techniques resulting in a guide for selecting methods when developing
  a discovery system; and to give an example of how to do so by presenting and describing
  a specific algorithm and a program implementing this algorithm. In addition, it
  is shown that this system provides solutions to real-world problems. The practical
  usability of the concepts described herein is the main focus throughout this thesis.'
