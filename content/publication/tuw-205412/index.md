abstract: VoIP (Voice over IP) systems more and more replacing PSTN (Public Switched
  Telephone Network) infrastructureswhat increases dependency of available and secure
  VoIP systems for successful business. Attacks against VoIP systems are becoming
  more imaginative and many attacks can cause damage, e.g., gain money for attackers
  or create costs for the victim. Therefore, in this paper the current security status
  of VoIP systems are described with observations of VoIP attacks in a honeynet. The
  achieved results can help to adapt existing prevention system to avoid the recognized
  and analyzed attacks in a productive environment.
