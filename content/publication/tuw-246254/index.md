abstract: As payment cards and mobile devices are equipped with Near Field Communication
  (NFC) technology, electronic payment transactions at physical Point of Sale (POS)
  environments are changing. Payment transactions do not require the customer to insert
  their card into a slot of the payment terminal. The customer is able to simply swipe
  the payment card or mobile phone in front of a dedicated zone of the terminal to
  initiate a payment transaction. Secure Elements (SEs) in mobile phones and payment
  cards with NFC should keep sensitive application data in a save place to protect
  it from abuse by attackers. Although hardware and the operating system of such a
  chip has to go through an intensive process of security testing, the current integration
  of such a chip in mobile phones easily allows attackers to access the information
  stored. In the following paper we present the implementation of two different proof-of-concept
  attacks. Out of the analysis of the attack scenarios, we propose various starting
  points for the forensic analysis in order to detect such fraudulent transactions.
  The presented concept should lead to fewer fraudulent transactions as well as protected
  evidence in case of fraud.
