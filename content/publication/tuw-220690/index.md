abstract: Business document types exchanged between business partners significantly
  differ among different industries and geopolitical regions. Therefore, the corresponding
  documents must be based on business document standards which can be adapted to any
  business context specific business scenario. In order to use a business document
  standard in a specific context, user groups develop so-called implementation guidelines
  based on a small subset of the standard. However, defining a new implementation
  guideline for a specific business context always starts from scratch, which is time-consuming
  and often leads to heterogeneous interpretations of the standard. It is our goal
  to speed up this development process and to create more homogeneous implementation
  guidelines by learning from existing models. Therefore, in this paper we define
  an ontology based model to formally represent business context. Furthermore, we
  propose an approach to assign instances of this model to already existing document
  implementation guidelines. This serves as a basis for calculation of the content
  model (subset) of a new implementation guideline which is relevant in a particular
  context presented by our ontology based business context model.
