abstract: Many software or web projects still underestimate the importance of the
  requirement analysis process. These projects often fail either due to inaccurately
  specified requirements or because of an inefficient requirement engineering process.
  A purpuseful process implies defining limiting conditions and taking basis, power
  and inspirational factors into consideration in order to select the best techniques
  for defining and reporting requirements. The task of the requirement analysis process
  goes far beyond defining requirements. On the one hand it can also be seen as a
  reduction in costs and on the other hand as a foundation for abiding a financial
  scope as well as a certain schedule. A main function lies especially in the fact,
  that this process is an important groundwork for an efficient implementation afterwards.
  This master thesis deals with the question how functional and non functional requirements
  can be found most efficiently and what certain techniques can be used for defining
  them. It is also investigated what criteria are responsible for choosing certain
  reporting techniques and how risks and changes in requirements can be taken into
  account. As a case study a procedure model of a large Austrian insurance company
  was analysed. Within the scope of this model essential processes like defining the
  status quo, identifying the stakeholders, IT business processes, functionalities,
  use cases, quality requirements and interfaces are definied roughly in socalled
  R-Modules and are finally followed by a review with all involved stakeholders. After
  this broad analysing phase these processes are specified in socalled A-Modules and
  evalvuated in a second review. This rough dealing with key issues in the R-Modules
  and the specificaton in the A-Modules enables a certain standard in quality management,
  an equal documation standard and a regulated predetermined procedure. In the scope
  of this master thesis a internet survey was aimed at IT professionals to examine
  the main issues like preparations, efficient procedure, validation process and finalisation
  in the requirement engineering process. The result of this survey was the deduction
  of key factors in these major issues of the requirement analysis process. Finally,
  the outcome of this master thesis is a procedure model in three different levels
  that clearly gives answeres to the question, how the requirement analysis process
  can be carried out in an efficient way under certain circumstances. By using three
  different levels of the procedure model it is ensured that a broad spectrum of projects
  with distinctive size and structure is covered in the field of software engineering.
