abstract: Service-oriented architectures (SOA) aim at the alignment of business and
  IT by having a clear business process-centric focus. In order to reach that goal,
  real-world business processes are captured by business process models. These models
  serve as the basis for the declarative configuration of a SOA using appropriate
  deployment artifacts - i.e., XML-based process languages. Consequently, requirements
  engineering for SOAs must focus on business processes and on their integration into
  systems using interoperable services, which is not the case for most conventional
  requirements engineering approaches. In this paper we present a requirements engineering
  approach specifically designed for the engineering of SOAs. Requirements are captured
  using a unified process, based on phases and iterations eventually leading to a
  formalized and unambiguous requirements specification. The final requirements specification
  can be used in succeeding development phases - i.e. for the model-driven generation
  of deployment artifacts for SOAs. The presented solution is called [vem:xi:] and
  is successfully used in the IT department of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) in
  Austria. In the highly volatile world of mobile communication the presented approach
  enables faster application development and faster integration of solutions, thus
  leading to a competitive advantage over other market participants.
