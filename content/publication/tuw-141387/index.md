abstract: In a B2B environment business partners interact with<br> each other by exchanging
  electronic business documents.<br> The agreements and commitments between the partner
  require<br> a certain order in the flow of business documents. This<br> flow - commonly
  known as choreography - often depends on<br> the actual content of a business document.
  E.g. the next step<br> depends on whether a price was stated in a quote document<br>
  or not in the step before. These characteristics usually affect<br> the states of
  a business entity - whether a quote is in state<br> provided or in state refused.
  The states of a business entity<br> usually define the next steps in the choreography
  of a collaborative<br> business process. Thus, it is important that the actual<br>
  business document content and resulting business entity<br> states are unambiguously
  defined in a global choreography.<br> In this paper we show how the modeling of
  business entity<br> state centric choreographies may be incorporated into<br> UN/CEFACTÂ´s
  modeling methodology (UMM) - one of the<br> best known approaches to model global
  choreographies.
