### Topic

With the number of vehicles, both private and commercial, in urban areas steadily increasing, accurate traffic information becomes an increasingly important commodity A change in transport policy, e.g., increased use of public transport and efficient inter-modal transport, will only have a medium to long-term effect on improving the traffic situations in inner-city areas. To create high-quality content for traffic management applications and mobility services, reliable and inexpensive real-time traffic is essential. The TRACK&amp;TRADE project relies on floating car data (FCD) to solve a number of well-known problems generating traffic content. While conventional traffic data collection systems have a high infrastructure maintenance and communication expense, exploits the FCD approach synergies with existing GPS-based fleet disposition systems. The scope of the project is to develop an FCD data mart that allows for the collection and integration of FCD data from as many data suppliers as possible. In turn, the data mart will supply aggregated datasets as well as valued-added services. Services include the provision of maps visually illustrating travel times and the provision of current and predicted travel times for parts of the road network. These services will be provided using XML and Web services and should simplify the creation of more complex services such routing and navigation as well as traffic forecasts. Trading FCD data and the provision of related services would serve two main purposes. (i) It creates an additional income stream for the data producers from an otherwise worthless resource and (ii) given that such data becomes generally available, it allows for the provision of improved traffic information services through a series of more or less technological means. With an increasing number of commercial vehicles (e.g., taxi fleets) being equipped with GPS, a successful business case for the FCD technology can be demonstrated.
