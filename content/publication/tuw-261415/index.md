abstract: The maintenance of modern systems often requires developers to perform complex
  and error-prone cognitive tasks, which are caused by the obscurity, redundancy,
  and irrelevancy of code, distracting from essential maintenance tasks.  Typical
  maintenance scenarios include multiple branches of code in repositories, which involves
  dealing with branch-interdependent changes, and aspects in aspect-oriented development,
  which requires in-depth knowledge of behavior-interdependent changes.  Thus, merging
  branched files as well as validating the behavior of statically composed code requires
  developers to conduct exhaustive individual introspection.    In this work we present
  VirtualEdit for associative, commutative, and invertible model composition. It allows
  simultaneous editing of multiple model versions or variants through dynamically
  derived virtual models.  We implemented the approach in terms of an open-source
  framework that enables multi-version editing and aspect-orientation by selectively
  focusing on specific parts of code, which are significant for a particular engineering
  task.    The VirtualEdit framework is evaluated based on its application to the
  most popular publicly available Xtext-based languages.  Our results indicate that
  VirtualEdit can be applied to existing languages with reasonably low effort.
