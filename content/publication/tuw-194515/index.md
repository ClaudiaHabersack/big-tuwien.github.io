abstract: Some 37 years after Alan C. Kay proposed that a portable, connected device
  could be used to support learning that concept has come astonishingly close to today's
  netbooks and smart phones providing the advantages of an active medium. Considering
  the saturation levels attained today with mobile devices and the ability to be Internet
  connected, the stage has been set to integrate those devices into the classroom.
  An investigation was conducted to include the efficient integration of smart phones
  in everyday learning considering didactic, organizational, and technical concepts.
  Research was initiated by collecting and categorizing potential scenarios in which
  mobile phones could be productively used, and analyzing scenarios for virtual teams.
  A Q&A Game was selected with the didactical goal to enhance the students' comprehension
  for a complicated subject matter. 24 students from a 6th grade secondary school
  (11-12 years old, 50% males, 50% females) who were familiar with Internet services
  participated in the test which was conducted at their school. It was astonishing
  how fast, trouble free, and smoothly they gathered the skills to accomplish the
  required tasks. The students showed not only an overall enthusiasm for the devices,
  but also explicitly for the teaching methods. Several critical success factors for
  the efficient use of smart phones in classes were then enumerated. The results indicated
  that smart phones are an efficient way to realize virtual teams in educational environments
  offering a wide variety of ways to support virtual teams in learning scenarios.
  In this paper technical and didactical recommendations that can be used to plan
  smart phone supported virtual team scenarios are presented.
