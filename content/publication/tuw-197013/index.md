abstract: Huge classes with more than 800 students pose a major challenge to lecturers
  as well as to students, especially when a practical part is included. In order to
  successfully master lectures of this size, novel kinds of teaching media provide
  a multitude of enhanced opportunities. In this paper, we present our experiences
  with the application of new media in our undergraduate course Introduction to Object-Oriented
  Modeling (OOM). In this course, we teach approximately 800-1000 students per year
  the principles and techniques of UML 2.0. New media, i.e., technologies other than
  the traditional blackboard presentation like a document camera, web-based self assessments,
  or lecture recordings, are applied to support both, students and lecturers when
  learning and teaching, respectively. We empirically underline the acceptance of
  our concept with the feedback of our students concerning the newly used technologies
  gained through an extensive survey.
