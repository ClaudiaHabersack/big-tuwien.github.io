abstract: The term Information Technology (IT) governance can be defined as the continuous
  management of an organizations's IT resources in order to optimally support the
  overall strategic business objectives. An IT organization can use international
  accepted standards for IT governance to achieve this goal. Internationally accepted
  standards are built on knowledge from a large community and can be valuable as a
  guideline or template in this process. In addition to document proven knowledge,
  several standards for IT governance provide certifications schemes in order to demonstrate
  quality to customers and shareholders. The goal of this master thesis is twofold.
  First, the master thesis is to support small and medium sized organizations managing
  information technology in the process of acquiring the required knowledge for implementing
  organizational structures and processes according to the Control Objectives for
  Information and Related Technology (COBIT), ISO/IEC 20000 and ISO/IEC 27001 standards.
  Second, the master thesis should provide methods supporting an organization's internal
  compliance audit of the three standards. The approach for solving both goals was
  to develop a common model that supports the learning process and compliance audit
  of the three standards. For the development of the model, several didactical considerations
  were taken into account. Especially the learning theories of cognitivism and constructivism
  influenced the structure and methods defined for the model. Moreover, the developed
  model can be used for measuring the maturity level of an IT organization's implemented
  business processes. The model's custom maturity levels are based on the Capability
  Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) approach and measure the maturity of processes
  as defined in COBIT, ISO 20000 and ISO 27001.
