  provides a conceptual approach named Core Components for defining business document
  types based on generic, reusable building blocks. For facilitating interoperability
  in Electronic Data Interchange, these reusable building blocks are defined in an
  all-embracing manner. Accordingly, business partners customize the standard business
  document types for fitting their needs and requirements, resulting in different
  business document type variants. However, the approach is missing sufficient mechanisms
  for managing business document model variants. First, customizing standardized business
  document types is purely based on a textual specification. Second, the variability
  present within the Core Component approach lacks an explicit representation. In
  this paper, we aim at making variability explicit as well as adding a formal aspect
  to the business document type customization process by employing variability concepts
  from Product Line Engineering. Furthermore, based on having explicit variability
  models, business partners are provided with an approach for customizing business
  document types through configuring variability models.
