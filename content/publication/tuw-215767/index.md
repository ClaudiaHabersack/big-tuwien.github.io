abstract: Lecture videos are slides enhanced with the audio recording of the lecturer's
  talk. Such lecture videos offer numerous advantages to the students as well as to
  the lecturers themselves. The former may organize their studies in a more flexible
  way by consuming the content of a lecture anytime and at any place as often as they
  want. The latter do not have to give the same lecture over and over again and may
  use the saved time for personal contact to the students. In this paper, we report
  on our experiences with using lecture videos in the course Introduction to Object-Oriented
  Modeling offered by the Business Informatics Group (BIG) at the Vienna University
  of Technology. We shortly review the structure of the course and discuss the creation
  and integration of the lecture videos. For the evaluation of this approach, we performed
  an online survey where the students could provide feedback. Parts of the results
  of this survey are discussed and included in the paper.
