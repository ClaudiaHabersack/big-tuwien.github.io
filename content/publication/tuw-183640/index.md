abstract: This paper presents a framework which can be used to establish knowledge  communities
  to transfer and co-create knowledge. A mapping between the  perspectives of knowledge
  management, organization and technology, and the  presentation of this in an easily
  communicable model, should provide for the creation  of state-of-the-art technology-enhanced
  communities. Scientific findings in the fields of  web-based learning, collaborative
  learning, social networks, collective intelligence  and virtual environments build
  the baseline for this technological mapping.
