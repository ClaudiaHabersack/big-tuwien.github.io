abstract: The software testing discipline has gained increasing importance over the
  past 30 years and is nowadays a vital part in every software project. To enhance
  efficiency and simultaneously reduce costs effort is put in the automation of recurring
  manual software testing tasks. The graphical user interface of a system plays a
  crucial role in establishing interaction between the system-s underlying functions
  and the user. Despite this fact, testing the graphical user interface is a complex
  and time-consuming task and automation strategies are still in an initial stage.
  Only rare information on the availability and maturity level of test automation
  tools for Java based rich client systems and on their suitability for practical
  application is available. This thesis overcomes this deficiency in knowledge by
  investigating six actively developed test automation tools, which are licensed as
  open source and are suitable for testing the graphical user interface of Java based
  desktop applications. To perform this investigation, the application of the selected
  tools within a representative example project is required. Due to its scope, level
  of complexity as well as usage of state of the art technologies the rich client
  of an existing event management system is chosen for this task. Object of study
  is the functional scope of the tools as well as non-functional quality parameters
  such as integrability, robustness and maintainability of the test scripts. Additionally,
  their suitability for practical application on the existing software project is
  analyzed. First, background information on the concept of graphical user interfaces
  as well as the discipline of software testing is provided. In order to select the
  best candidates, a criteria catalog containing general and project specific requirements
  for test automation tools is developed and evaluated. Following this, six automation
  tools, namely FEST, Marathon, Abbot, Sikuli, Robot Framework and WindowTester Pro,
  are chosen for further investigation. In the main part of this thesis a feasibility
  study is conducted in which the functioning of each test automation tool is analyzed
  by implementing five representative test cases from the existing software project.
  Furthermore, advantages as well as weaknesses of each tool are discussed and possible
  improvements are introduced. It is concluded, that none of the tools investigated
  is ready for practical application without extensive adaption work prior to usage.
  The results obtained from this feasibility study are due to the representative character
  of the chosen example project also highly relevant for inexperienced testers or
  small companies that cannot afford licenses for commercial test automation tools.
  They can serve as a decision guideline when introducing test automation in similar
  projects.
