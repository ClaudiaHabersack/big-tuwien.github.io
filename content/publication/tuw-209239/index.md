abstract: In this paper we present the ERPEL approach towards executing on-the-fly
  e-business transactions between semantically enabled ERP systems. By on-the-fly
  e-business transactions we understand transactions that are conducted between companies,
  that are not yet in a partnership and dynamically find each other to engage in e-business
  transactions. Finding an appropriate business partner requires to know his business
  capabilities or in other words which products or services he offers. For this purpose,
  we develop a seamless integration of the product portfolios, held in the ERP systems,
  into the ERPEL registry. A search in the registry has to disclose the technical
  capabilities of a potential business partner to ensure interoperability. Overloaded
  business document standards and a variety of different communication protocols hamper
  an effective communication between enterprises. Thus, ERPEL follows a bottom-up
  approach starting from core documents with well-defined extension mechanisms. Furthermore,
  ERPEL comes with a default communication protocol specifically targeting SMEs. These
  unambiguous specifications allow the development of business service interfaces
  (BSI) that are integrated into the ERP systems.
