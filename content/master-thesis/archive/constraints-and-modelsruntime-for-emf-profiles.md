Modeling languages play an essential part in the software engineering process. While UML is currently the primarily used language for this purpose, others such as Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) are catching up. EMF Profiles is a project developed by the Business Informatics Group to ease the creation of such DSMLs. Since EMF Profiles is a prototype it still has some limitations, which prevent the creation of certain modeling languages. This Master Thesis aims to develop and evaluate a framework based on the EMF Profiles prototype, which provides support for Models with strong constraints and runtime behavior.
