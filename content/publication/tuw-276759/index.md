abstract: Research in areas of Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 (I4.0), Cyber
  Physical Systems (CPS), consider system-of-systems composed of hardware and software
  systems that seamless work together. Interoperability ranges from compatibility
  (systems do not disturb other systems, but no interaction between systems) to integration
  (systems that share a common model/worldview). Between these extremes a continuum
  of interoperability exists.  In any case, interoperability is a model-driven approach
  - in contrast to data-driven or machine-learning approaches, for example. In general,
  models contain modules, connections, and behavior descriptions of different types.  Integration
  and interoperability may not only be seen as (goal) states but also as processes.
  Changes in one system might trigger adaptation in other systems. However, in loose
  integration and interoperability settings there is more support for the evolution
  of models.
