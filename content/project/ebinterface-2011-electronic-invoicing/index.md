### Topic

The Austrian e-billing standard ebInterface has been supported by major Austrian ERP-vendors. Because of ongoing market changes the new version ebInterface 4.0 shall be realised. The corresponding XSLT has to be adapted for Web-Browsers. Former projects have already shown possible alternatives to extend the kernel of the standard with sectoral extensions. In the course of this project the dicsussion with ERP vendors and interested users featured alternatives will be integraded into the standard. Aditionally there will be an extension for a concrete branch. This extions also has to be integrated into the XSLT. Furthermore all implementations of the ERP vondors or users, respectively have always to be checked according to the standard to guarantee a smooth integration of new partners. For this purpose an automatic checking service should be developed that should enable to check the kernel standard as well es existing extensions and partner specific restrictions, respectively, given that they have been provided to the checking service in an appropriate form.
