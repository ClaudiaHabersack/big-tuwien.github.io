abstract: Today, most approaches for inter-organizational business processes start
  bottom-up from the interfaces and the workflows of each partner described on the
  IT layer. Alternatively, one may start from the commitments and agreements between
  business partners to reach their complementary business goals. The latter approach
  is target of the UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology (UMM), which models a global choreography.
  In a model driven approach the UMM artifacts must be further elaborated toward an
  IT solution for each participating business partner. For this purpose we have developed
  a UML profile to model a local choreography or an orchestration that respects the
  agreements made in the global choreography. In order to execute the local choreography
  / orchestration in the local IT, the processes must be machine-readable. For this
  purpose we demonstrate a transformation to the business process execution language
  (WS-BPEL).
