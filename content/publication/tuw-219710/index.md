abstract: 'The IEEE Conference on Business Informatics (CBI) constitutes the next
  step in the evolution of the IEEE Conference on e-Commerce and Enterprise Computing
  (CEC). The first event under this new banner takes place in Vienna, Austria, July
  15 - 18, 2013. The change in the name and scope of the conference is congruent to
  the renaming of the IEEE Technical Committee on e-Commerce to the IEEE Technical
  Committee on Business Informatics and Systems (TCBIS).  In summary, the program
  of CBI 2013 consists of nine key note presentations on the research domains, 15
  academic paper sessions, three industry paper sessions, three workshops, a tutorial
  and a panel. We are looking forward to innovative research results and high quality
  contributions on a broad range of business informatics. This has been guaranteed
  by a very selective paper selection process. In total we received 103 submissions
  from 29 countries to the research tracks of the conference. Each submission received
  at least three review reports, whereby the reviews were based on five criteria:
  relevance to the subject of the conference track, originality, technical depth,
  potential impact on the community, and presentation. Out of the total amount of
  103 submissions, the program committee selected 26 full papers in the research track.
  This results in an acceptance rate of 25% for full research papers. Furthermore,
  16 short papers were accepted. In addition, these proceedings include 9 papers of
  the industry track, and 13 papers of the workshops.'
