abstract: 'Code reviews enhance software quality, so they should always be a part
  of our daily work. In our session we will present an ECLIPSE integrated code review
  plug-in, which helps developers to review the source code efficient on a per changeset
  basis - the item under inspection is one changeset in the revision control system.  The
  tight integration of the review plug-in into the ECLIPSE development environment
  helps the developer to accept the review task as his daily work, like debugging
  or re-factoring.  Because of its simple design it''s possible to initiate the review
  process on any existing project in a few minutes. All review data is stored within
  files, shared with the already configured subversion repository of your project.
  So there is no need to setup any server-side application, apart from the already
  existing subversion repository. The reviewer uses a special review editor to inspect
  the changesets, compares different versions of a file with the compare editor, and
  leaves his rating and optional comments for the commiter of the changeset. The review
  editor aligns with the basic concepts of the ECLIPSE environment,  so the initial
  training will consume little time. Here are some features of the ECLIPSE plug-in:  Easy
  to use review editor  Easy installation and configuration, no server-side application
  needed  Flexible Author/Reviewer assignments, supporting different types of reviewing
  (Peer vs. Master)  Assignments may be scheduled within periods, supporting review
  iterations  Re-use of the Compare-Editor to show file differences between revisions  Enhanced
  Review-Editor to manage assignments and code reviews  An extended version of the
  review plugin, based on the ECLIPSE Collaboration Framework, further provides notifications,
  e.g. about new review comments.  The Vienna University of Technology uses this review
  plug-in for many software development projects.  The flexible design allows to use
  different types of review models, whichever fits best into your software engineering
  process. The assignments may be done in a peer to peer manner, where the developers
  inspect the code changes of one or more team members. Reading each others code has
  the consequence, that developers also learn the code from their colleagues, thus
  supporting collective code ownership. As a result, a better code sharing and reuse
  will be more likely, the team''s interaction and creativity will be  encouraged.
  A more hierarchical approach would be to assign a senior developer to review the
  code for new or less experienced developers. The senior developer in the role of
  the reviewer may enforce coding standards and better code quality within the development
  team.  Because of our positive experience with the plug-in and the good feedback
  we have received, we will release the review plug-in under an open-source license
  prior to the EclipseCon 2009.'
