abstract: 'IT security is an important aspect of the software development life cycle
  and thorough security testing is necessary to ensure the quality of the software.
  To cope with the increasing complexity and amount of software, security testing
  is required to increase its efficiency through the development of automated testing
  methods. However, the manual analysis of the results produced by an automated test
  execution can be very cumbersome and extremely time consuming. The purpose of this
  thesis is to optimize the analysis phase through the automatic evaluation of test
  results and detection of suspicious test cases. In this work the optimization task
  was approached by using methods from the research field of machine learning. To
  this aim several supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods were investigated:
  Artificial Neural Network, Self-Organizing Map, Support Vector Machine, c-Means
  Clustering. Based on the prototypes created in this thesis, the four approaches
  were evaluated in terms of their applicability in detecting suspicious behaviour
  of the test subject. The results show that machine learning methods are well suited
  for an integration into a security testing framework. Three out of four implementations
  displayed a high vulnerability detection rate while maintaining a straightforward
  implementation, fast running times and easy adaptation into various projects. Integrated
  into a security testing system, machine learning methods can improve the analysis
  phase of the test execution. With their help the amount of manual labor can be decreased
  without any loss of vulnerability detection rate.'
