abstract: We report the design and evaluation of a novel game controller text entry
  method called TwoStick. The design is based on the review of previous work and several
  rounds of pilot testing. We compared user performance with TwoStick experimentally
  to a selection keyboard which is the de facto standard of game controller text entry.
  Eight participants completed 20 fifteenminute sessions with both text entry methods.
  In the beginning TwoStick was slower (4.3 wpm, uncorrected error rate = 0.68%) than
  the selection keyboard (5.6 wpm, 0.85%). During the last session TwoStick was faster
  (14.9 wpm, 0.86% vs. 12.9 wpm, 0.27%). Qualitative results indicated that TwoStick
  was more fun and easier to use than the selection keyboard.
