abstract: This diploma thesis explores how physical behavior of virtual objects affects
  the per- ceived pragmatic and hedonic quality of interactive products as well as
  peoples' judgements of its goodness and aesthetics. The thesis proposes a model
  of user experience (UX) to explain how users' perceptions and judgements of a product
  are influenced by its features. It does so by incorporating theories about aesthetics
  and emotions into the hedonic/pragmatic model of UX. It argues that physical behavior
  of virtual objects can be considered aesthetic, and thus result in a better user
  experience. To verify the impact of physical behavior, I built a prototype for conducting
  card sorting tasks on an Apple iPad. Two variations of this prototype were used
  in an explorative study. Participants conducted card sorting tasks with a physical
  and a non-physical variation of the prototype and assessed their perceptions and
  judgements using an extended version of the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire. The analysis
  of the experiment confirmed that physical behavior can indeed improve the user experience.
  Physical behavior is, however, not applicable in all circumstances and seems to
  be most valuable in conjunction with touch screens and natural user interfaces (NUIs).
  The thesis concludes by discussing potential implications and possible limitations
  of this study, that is, circumstances in which physical behavior can be used and
  the expected impact on UX.
