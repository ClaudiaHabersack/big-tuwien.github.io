abstract: Inter-organizational systems have significantly<br> been affected by Service-oriented
  Architectures (SOA) andWeb<br> Services - the state-of-the-art technology to implement
  SOA.<br> SOA is said to enable quick and inexpensive changes of the<br> IT in order
  to establish new business partnerships or to reflect<br> changes in existing partnerships.
  However, current approaches<br> to inter-organizational systems focus too much on
  existing Web<br> Services standards and, thus, on the technology layer. In such<br>
  an approach the technology drives the business. In this paper<br> we analyze the
  shortcomings of this bottom-up approach. As<br> an alternative we suggest a top-down
  methodology where the<br> business requirements drive the technology. This methodology<br>
  starts off with the business value perspective, leading to a<br> business process
  perspective and resulting in an IT execution<br> perspective. We do not invent any
  new approaches on each of<br> these layers, rather we outline how existing approaches
  are used<br> and combined into a business requirements driven approach<br> to inter-organizational
  systems.
