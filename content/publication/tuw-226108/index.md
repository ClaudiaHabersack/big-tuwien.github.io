abstract: Nowadays most applications use Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to interact
  with the user. Those GUIs are frequently used by attackers to manipulate applications.
  Although applications are usually tested intensely, the GUIs of the applications
  are rarely checked with respect to the most critical security aspects. To increase
  the robustness of the applications, appropriate automated security testing is required
  the identifies vulnerabilities in the application reliably. The objective of this
  master's thesis is to design a comprehensive GUI testing framework that not only
  allows functional testing of GUIs but also security tests. First, fundamentals of
  automated security testing of GUIs and relevant requirements of these are discussed
  through literature research. Subsequently, a comparative overview of existing tools
  for GUI testing is given. This research shows that most of the tools are only suitable
  for functional testing, where as using these tools for security testing is not feasible.
  Reasons for that are the lack of support for suitable analytical systems to identify
  emerging vulnerabilities and a clear separation between test data and test cases.
  The latter is required for executing the test cases with many different security-relevant
  test data. Based on these observations a new platform- and programming language-independent
  testing framework is designed. It builds on existing solutions to support many different
  applications with different GUIs (e.g. Java applications and websites). The designed
  framework supports not only functional testing of the GUIs but particularly considers
  the special requirements of security tests. The proposed design serves as a model
  for the development of GUI testing frameworks to increase the quality and security
  of GUIs.
