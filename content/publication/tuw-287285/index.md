abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) in academic software development has not
  been subject to a substantial amount of research so far. While subjects like agile
  practices in academic software projects have been covered in detail, the focus was
  never placed on the development process as a whole. While gamification has been
  applied to various aspects of software development, research on applications in
  the field of SQA are scarce. Throughout this thesis, the author evaluated several
  practices aimed at improving SQA in a case study. For the purpose of making Quality
  Assurance (QA) related tasks more appealing, the author used concepts of gamification.
  Representing a typical student software project, the Mineralbay project, started
  by the Montanuniversit√§t Leoben in cooperation with the research group Industrial
  Software (INSO) of the Vienna University of Technology (TU), built the underlying
  case. The goals of the thesis were formulated as several research questions dividing
  the complex subject of quality assurance into the levels of process, coding and
  documentation. Initially, a thorough analysis of the development process as a whole
  was performed, highlighting deficits and bad smells in terms of SQA. Interviews
  and surveys were held, gaining insights on the developers view of SQA in the given
  setup. The result was a multitude of possible improvements which was elaborated
  and subsequently expressed as a list of research questions. In order for the results
  to gain general validity, the representativeness of the underlying case was assured
  by expert interviews, where domain experts identified Mineralbay as a typical student
  software project. The proposed measures were evaluated and data was collected using
  interviews, participant observation as well as surveys. The gained results suggested
  that high software quality in student projects is a product of multiple factors.
  An easy to understand, working and non-frustrating build process forms a solid basis.
  A profound set of tests should be executed on each change, preventing regression.
  An unreliable or hard to maintain build process will not be followed. A tailored
  review process (on code, but also configuration basis) supported by easy to use
  tools has been identified as another key factor of quality assurance, as well as
  for knowledge transfer. Introducing code style guidelines will help for better readability
  and maintainability. Integrated Development Environment (IDE), integrated tools
  for checking code compliance and auto correction are important for developers in
  this context. Static code analysis will help uncovering bad code, improve code quality
  as well as developer knowledge. Gamification has furthermore been identified as
  a way of making otherwise unrewarding quality assurance tasks more attractive. The
  elaborated and evaluated gamification tools did increase motivation to attend these
  kind of tasks. Based on the gathered conclusions, a list of suggestions on how to
  implement quality assurance in a typical student software project was compiled.
