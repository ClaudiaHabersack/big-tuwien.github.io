abstract: Social web services have gained enormous popularity over the past years
  because of a steadily increasing demand for user participation in the whole web
  sphere. Social networks like MySpace or Facebook and media sites like Flickr or
  YouTube clearly demonstrate the variety and functionality of social sites. Significantly
  affected by this trend, online retail and e-commerce environments rapidly changed
  within the last years. Users were integrated into existing e-shops and mutated from
  simple buyers to fully integrated customers. Thus, a modern shop visitor can recommend
  products, leave comments, rate vendors or publish wish lists. This recent phenomenon,
  called social commerce or social shopping, leads to more customer satisfaction,
  user participation and social interaction. Accordingly, there is a strong demand
  for innovative social commerce models and concepts like crowdsourcing, consumer
  generated content or live shopping. This paper shows the results of an extended
  analysis of collaborative shopping networks and demonstrates the development of
  a representative interaction model. An evaluation of social commerce models gave
  insights into functionalities, interactions and entities of successful social web
  applications. To create a collaborative shopping network model, conventional web
  services as well as selected best practice cases were analyzed in detail. To meet
  the demands of modern consumers, success factors are presented in the final part.
