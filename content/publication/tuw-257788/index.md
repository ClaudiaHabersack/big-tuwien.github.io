abstract: This thesis analyses and challenges the fast and dynamic movement of new
  technologies, particularly in developing countries like Mozambique. The work places
  itself in the research field of Information and Communication Technologies for Development
  (ICT4D). The research was carried out as part of the project; Information and Communication
  Technology for Development in Mozambique (ICT4DMZ), which is carried out by a consortium
  consisting of the Maputo Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (Maputo UEM), the Technische
  Universit√§t Wien (TU Wien) and the Austrian Network for Information and Communication
  Technologies for Development (ICT4D.at). The focus of this work lies in the context
  of mobile technologies in developing countries and on how people can access information
  on these devices properly. An Android prototype application designed to navigate
  people around the campus was developed in a lecture with students. A survey carried
  out as part of the research indicated that the Android application is not accessible
  to certain students due to a lack of technology and connectivity. Therefore an alternative
  SMS based interface is introduced to meet the criteria of Human Computer Interaction
  for Development (HCI4D) and Universal Design. The new solution uses already existing
  and cheap infrastructure, focuses on low-end hardware, works along with future-proof
  alternatives and does, in comparison with the Android application, not exclude potential
  users.
