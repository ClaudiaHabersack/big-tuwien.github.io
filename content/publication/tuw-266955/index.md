abstract: People frequently use internet-based messaging systems to coordinate. In
  order to achieve that, it is sufficient for them to exchange natural language messages.
  The message history they generate can be seen as a shared database that can be tapped
  into by personal assistive systems; moreover, messaging is increasingly used for
  human-computer communication. However, if natural language understanding is required
  for such systems to function properly, the cost of developing them is high and only
  few market players will be able to compete. If, on the other hand, it is possible
  to mix machine-interpretable data with natural language conversations, assistive
  or conversational programs may be developed more easily. As a first important challenge,
  we tackle the problem of negotiating agreements and unambiguously represent what
  has been agreed upon in a machine-readable form. In this paper, we propose an extension
  of the Web of Needs, a decentralized, Linked Data based matching and messaging system,
  to allow conversation partners to produce a mutually agreed-upon RDF dataset.
