abstract: Based on existing research in the field of viable system modelling, social
  systems and the corporate genome, this paper presents a framework for the modelling
  and managing of viable knowledge- intensive research projects, which require the
  generation of new knowledge within a dynamic and complex world. This framework presents
  an overall look at the different levels which need to be established in order to
  implement a new, self-organised and viable system able to realise the defined aims
  of research projects.
