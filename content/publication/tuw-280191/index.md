abstract: There is a big potential for process optimizations, due to the digitalization
  gap in the<br> construction business. New digital technologies, as the Building
  Information Modelling<br> (BIM), are increasingly being adapted by the stakeholders
  in this area. On the other hand,<br> blockchain is a very new and innovative technology
  domain which has grown immensely<br> in the last several years, and where people
  are now trying to find the right use-cases.<br> Especially, the even newer field
  of smart contract development has opened the door for<br> a large amount of possible
  applications, where it is neither clear if these can actually<br> be implemented
  as envisioned, nor if there is even a need for a decentralized solution<br> at all.
  In a construction project, changes on BIM models are only to be approved by<br>
  the appropriate stakeholder. Therefore, we have combined the BIM models, which are<br>
  stored using a Git repository, with a release management workflow, which is realised
  as a<br> smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.This enables the workflow to
  be transparent,<br> traceable and its results to be immutable. The goal of this
  work is to create a prototype<br> and compare it to other (off-chain) solutions
  and to evaluate if an application of a<br> combination of BIM and blockchain yields
  an advantage in terms of costs and security.
