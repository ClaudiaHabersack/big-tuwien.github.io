abstract: Global software engineering environments feature a remote customer in many
  of today´s software engineering projects. We developed a university course design
  to better match these real-world conditions with developer teams comprised of European
  students and customer teams comprised of Indian stu- dents. Our distributed student
  teams were asked to autonomously find the best way to overcome the three big challenges
  in global software engineering, communication, cooperation and coordi- nation, and
  establish a working relationship between developer team and customer team. Key findings
  include that language difficulties and cultural differences were among the hardest
  challenges to overcome. Post-course feedback was very positive, as both European
  and Indian students highly valued the realistic learning experience, even though
  Indian students noted that they would prefer to be on the development team.
