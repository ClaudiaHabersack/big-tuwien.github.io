abstract: Adequate IT support for Business-to-Business integration(B2Bi) is indispensable
  in today´s globalized world. Agreement among personnel from different enterprises
  as well as distributed computing issues are major challenges to the automation of
  B2Bi processes. These challenges can be addressed by applying the choreography language
  ebXML BPSS (ebBP) for declaratively specifying B2Bi processes and using Web services
  and WS-BPEL as dedicated integration technologies. ebBP Business Transactions (BT)
  are the primary building block of ebBP choreographies and specify the exchange of
  up to two business documents in a declarative and technology-agnostic way. Composing
  BTs within choreographies and realization of QoS raise important requirements for
  the orchestration layer. This paper investigates these requirements and presents
  a composable, abstract, flexible and QoS-aware execution model that can be implemented
  using Web Services and BPEL.
