abstract: Software reviews are one of the most efficient quality assurance techniques
  in software engineering. They are used to find defects in early stages of a project's
  progress. It is less expensive to correct early detected defects than defects which
  are identified in late phases of a project. In addition, they help team members
  to get a better understanding of the code and to enforce coding standards and guidelines.
  Undetected defects during the software development process can have significant
  consequences, such as reduced customer satisfaction, increased safety risk and decreased
  productivity of the users. In order to avoid them, development teams use software
  reviews to improve the quality of the product by reviewing interim deliverables
  during the development. In the last thirty years several formal and less formal
  approaches for the application of reviews were developed. Despite their advantages,
  they are not universally used because in many cases a review tool that assists a
  company's review process does not exist. This is presented in a case study with
  the company Frequentis, whose task-based development process is not sufficiently
  supported by an existing review tool. The internationally acting company develops
  software in the field of civil air traffic management (ATM), and therefore has to
  fulfill the DO-278/ED-109 software standard. A significant part of the standard
  is devoted to the quality assurance process and especially to code reviews. This
  work describes a lightweight task-based review process which was developed based
  on theoretical analyses and company specific requirements. It is related to a peer
  deskcheck or passaround method and consists of four phases. A case study shows how
  the process can be used by Frequentis for the assurance of software quality. Based
  on this, a custom review plug-in for the popular Eclipse development environment
  was designed and implemented. This plug-in is used to apply the task-based review
  process. Furthermore, it supports the planning of reviews by suggesting qualified
  reviewers for defined parts of the source code. For the verification of the review
  results and the review coverage, it also allows the generation of reports.
