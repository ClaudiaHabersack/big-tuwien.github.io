abstract: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is subject to fast progression
  where technologies and methods are permanently evolving and changing. This situation
  demands special requirements of education and training in this field to ensure the
  availability of highly educated specialists. This master thesis presents a technical
  foundation for software engineering education to support teachers in the creation
  of industrial-like assignments. A main feature is the customization to specific
  needs of various academic courses with different main topics. Possible fields of
  application of this framework are lectures regarding software engineering, software
  testing, software quality assurance or security. To ensure this feature, the basis
  framework was designed in a way that components and technologies can be exchanged.
  The foundation consists of loosely coupled components and utilizes state of the
  art technologies. It also provides extension points for future developments. It
  is based in the domain mobile ticketing due to its many cross cutting concerns,
  omnipresence and support from modern technologies. Research was performed to elaborate
  the common knowledge a well-trained software engineer must possess, as well as the
  current state of teaching software engineering in an academic setting. In addition,
  the current level of development of mobile ticketing along with supporting technologies
  were surveyed. The results of the research are presented in this thesis. One possible
  customization of the foundation is demonstrated by the concrete example of a software
  engineering course, where the existing technical base was replaced. The course assignment
  consists of an industrial-like project setting for groups of four to six students.
  Based on the course assignment and the replaced foundation, each group had to develop
  a ticketing application. An evaluation was performed to assess the quality of the
  application of the base framework in context of this course. A questionnaire was
  designed and given to tutors, who supervised students during the course. The results
  of the questionnaire is stated and interpreted. The evaluation results show that
  the learning objectives were well imparted. Students were highly motivated and most
  of the projects were successfully finished. Some minor issues arose, which will
  be addressed in future courses.
