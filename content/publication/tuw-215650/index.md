abstract: Open source software typically is developed in distributed communities,
  which employ specialized means of management and cooperation. The purpose of this
  research is to study and define a modern open source development process by identifying
  elements shared by open source projects and determining aspects in which they differ.
  Furthermore, the thesis investigates how open source development relates to structured
  processes on one hand, and agile methods on the other. Essential elements of the
  open source process are identified and compared with those of four process models
  which are widely used in proprietary development, namely the RUP, PMBoK, Scrum and
  XP. In an empirical case study grounded on qualitative interviews, developers of
  three active open source projects provide in-depth information on the lifecycle
  and practices used in the projects' development. This data is used to show how open
  source communities have created a distinct way of development, which is based on
  a shared culture and is uniquely adapted to its environment of distributed collaboration,
  voluntary contribution and developer participation. It is shown how open source
  development distinguishes itself from other approaches of creating software by a
  number of specific characteristics. Suggestions are offered how to improve both
  open source development processes and proprietary forms of development.
