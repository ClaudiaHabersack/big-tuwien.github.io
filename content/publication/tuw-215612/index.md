abstract: This paper describes a realistic implementation of a document management
  system for a selected group of employees (Turnusarzt) onto a hospital department.
  A concept of an information system - called Hospital Employee Info Point (HEIP)
  - is the target of this work. There is a theoretical discussion about processes
  used in a daily hospital business, which are compared to classical IT-applications.
  The outcome is the consciousness that factors influencing the operative process
  in hospital are more complicated compared to a business company. At first, there
  is a grouping of IT-applications and IT-initiatives used in the public health sector.
  After an introduction of aspects of knowledge-management-process concerning IT-issues
  and IT-solutions there is a presentation of software solutions. There is also a
  description of points of knowledge-passing-process, because they affect a successful
  introduction and operation of an IT-application in this area considerably. A description
  of two implementations in other domains reflects steps and workload. Document-management-process
  is a possibility to realize the ideas of knowledge-management. This mode of knowledge
  transfer has revealed as most optimal for HEIP-realization, by the way document
  management plays a major role in a hospital process. Subsequently, there is also
  a presentation of didactical aspects (reading and writing). These didactical aspects
  can be seen as a counterpart to data-modeling and data-evaluation of a classic IT-application.
  In the context of application development there will be a criteria-catalogue presented
  which can assist a decision-finding-process. The closing pilot implementation is
  carried out in server variants - as a local and as a cross-linked application.
