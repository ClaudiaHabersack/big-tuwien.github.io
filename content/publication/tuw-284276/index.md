abstract: IoT systems are becoming an increasingly important component of the civil
  and industrial infrastructure. With the growth of these IoT ecosystems, their complexity
  is also growing exponentially. In this paper we explore the problem of testing and
  evaluating large scale IoT systems at design time. To this end we employ simulated
  sensors with the physical and geographical characteristics of real sensors. Moreover,
  we propose Sensyml, a simulation environment that is capable of generating big data
  from cyber-physical models and real-world data. To the best of our knowledge it
  is the first approach to use a hybrid integration of real and simulated sensor data,
  that is also capable of being integrated into existing IoT systems. Sensyml is a
  cloud based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) system that enables users to test
  both functionality and scalability of their IoT applications.
