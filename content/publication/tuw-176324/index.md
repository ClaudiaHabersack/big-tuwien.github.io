abstract: 'Business-to-business (B2B) electronic commerce builds upon inter-organizational
  business processes that cross the borders of enterprises. Their design and implementation
  presupposes a different approach than intra-organizational processes do. Experience
  shows that bottom-up approaches starting from the IT layer of a single enterprise
  - expecting that all other business partners adjust to it - do not work out. Instead,
  a prolific B2B design approach must consider three layers in a top-down manner:
  Firstly, the economic perspective identifies the players and their value exchanges
  within a business network resulting in a business model. Secondly, business collaboration
  models specify the choreography of inter-organizational business processes in accordance
  with the business model. Finally, the business collaboration models are transformed
  to deployment artifacts to be interpreted by IT systems. In this thesis, we propose
  a design approach for B2B integration based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML)
  considering all three layers.'
