abstract: Usability engineering, particularly user centered design, plays a decisive
  role in software development. Specifically heuristic evaluations are considered
  to be the most popular inspection method, practiced by a small set of evaluators
  who examine an interface and judge its compliance with the previously defined principles
  (heuristics). Its crucially important advantage is the possibility to apply it both
  in early and in final stages of development, thus rendering this method significantly
  more cost-effective than other methods. This thesis is motivated by the idea of
  supporting usability experts in the process of distributing heuristic evaluations
  of user interfaces. This was accomplished through the development of a new web application
  to enable centralized document management as well as to optimize administrative
  procedures. This web application is implemented in PHP 4 and utilizes HTML 4.01
  and CSS in addition to a MySql database. It supports all aspects of heuristic evaluation
  processes and enables usability experts to evaluate a project jointly on networks
  such as the Internet. By allowing centralized storage of all necessary data, the
  application facilitates analyses and ensures administrative support for the usability
  experts performing a heuristic evaluation. The tool´s main advantage, however, clearly
  consists in the possibility of documenting usability problems more efficiently.
  During its development, the prototype was evaluated in the context of a software
  quality test as well as a user acceptance test. The conclusions drawn from these
  examinations formed the basis for further improvement in the tool´s performance.
  As a result, the presented final version of the web tool meets all defined requirements
  and proved to be particularly time- and cost-effective in heuristic evaluation processes.
