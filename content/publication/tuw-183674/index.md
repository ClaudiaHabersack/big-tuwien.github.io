abstract: These days companies daily face the challenges of global competition. Processes
  are increasingly complex, dynamic and distinctive. With regard to social aspects,
  these circumstances require adaptations in terms of cooperation. Frequently, a process
  can not be handled in one single site anymore, also teams are more often allocated
  in different countries. Spatial and temporal barriers lead teams to new challenges.
  These new and evolving requirements of cooperation can be encountered, from an IT
  point of view, with groupware. This master thesis deals with the question of which
  requirements a collaboration software framework has to meet, in order to realize
  representative business processes for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) using
  groupware. In a first step a scientific basis of the term groupware and the requirement
  of companies to the topic cooperation will be elaborated. Based on this representative
  business processes will be modelled and analyzed. The representative and for collaboration
  purposes in SME created business processes concern a holiday management, identification
  of know-how carrier, synchronous and asynchronous communication, distributed collaboration
  within a project and allocation of human resource. These processes can be classified
  into communicative-, collaborative-, and coordinative business process types. The
  business processes will be reengineered by Business Process Reengineering (BPR),
  integrating innovative groupware solutions. In the target state communicative processes
  will use concepts as Awareness and digital tools in order to allow users to communicate
  their availability and to perform meetings in a more interactive way. Coordinative
  processes will focus on the automation of workflows. The administration of information
  and states should be encapsulated. Cooperative processes will provide central and
  public data storing, which will help to keep the consistency and to avoid redundancy.
  The reorganized processes will be realized by adequate software. The decision which
  software matches the requirements is based on a software screening and a software
  evaluation. The selected software is logically encapsulated in a framework and develops
  its full collaboration effects as a whole. Result of this master thesis is a universal,
  in SME applicable, collaboration software framework for representative business
  processes that leads to a substantial optimization of cooperation and the enhancement
  of benefit in companies. The emerging collaboration software framework is suitable
  for cost conscious SME's which want to improve the quality of collaboration.
