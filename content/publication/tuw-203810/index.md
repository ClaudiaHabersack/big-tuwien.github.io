abstract: Ever faster changing market conditions require businesses to frequently
  adapt their business processes and the underlying workflow systems. Serviceoriented
  architectures are said to deliver this flexibility by loose coupling. In this chapter
  we provide a survey on realizing flexible workflows on top of service oriented architectures.We
  show how orchestrations and choreographies may be implemented by state-of-the-art
  web services technology. The role of agents in realizing workflows among services
  is discussed. Furthermore, we discuss service provision in dynamic environments,
  when partners are dynamically bound to the workflow and when changes to the workflow
  schema happen.
