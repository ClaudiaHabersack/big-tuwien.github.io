abstract: Multi-display environments (MDE) consist of one or multiple shared displays
  for co-located collaboration and include additional input devices with displays
  for each collaborator. They improve traditional collaborative computer environments
  by giving users more fexibility. The increased availability of portable devices,
  like mobile phones or tablet computers (tablets), provides an opportunity to investigate
  their integration into collaborative MDEs. However, little information is available
  regarding techniques for sharing and transferring digital content between serveral
  multi-touch surfaces and the role of personal devices in digitally supported collaborative
  environments. In this thesis, the implementation of a MDE with multi-touch input
  on both shared and personal displays is presented. This system was evaluated regarding
  task performance, user preferences and collaboration strategies and compared to
  a standard multi-touch tabletop setting. Eight participant pairs had to solve a
  collaborative sorting task in four different conditions. One of the conditions only
  involved the shared display and the other three included the use of additional tablets
  as personal displays. In the conditions with personal displays, participants were
  able to transfer documents from the tabletop onto their tablets with one of three
  specifically developed transfer technique. In the first technique (buttons), each
  document featured one button per user for transferring it. In the second technique
  (containers), the shared surface featured two containers representing the participants'
  tablets, enabling drag-and-dropping of documents. The third technique (lenses) allowed
  participants to pick up documents by moving the tablet across the tabletop. Based
  on the analysis of observational data, system log files, video recordings, interviews
  and questionnaires four distinct collaboration strategies, specific for MDEs, were
  identified. Teams chose diverse strategies in the conditions with different transfer
  techniques. The analysis of users' performance showed that the lenses technique
  was significantly faster regarding task completion time compared to the buttons
  technique. This could be caused by the simplictity of the buttons technique that
  led to an increased document transfer between devices and less coordinated task-solving
  strategies. Although users preferred the collaboration with the tablets, overall
  task performance and the amount of close collaboration was slightly higher in the
  condition without the tablets. The additional use of personal multi-touch tablets
  did not decrease the awareness of collaborators' activities. Working with the tablets
  enabled participants to choose diverse collaboration strategies to solve the given
  task.
