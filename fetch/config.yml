  # Automatic profile creation:
  #   * The TISS API result contains user records that are not meant to be displayed.
  #   * This whitelist can be used to filter the result set.
  #   * The script will create a profile page IF AND ONLY IF
  #     - the person's name is on the following whitelist
  #     - the person is a member of the BIG TISS research unit
  #     - the name matches the person's name used in TISS
  # WARNING: A person's courses and publications will only be fetched if included on this whitelist.
  #          In some cases it may be necessary to whitelist people that are not members of the BIG TISS research unit
  #          in order to fetch their publications. Records like that will not have a profile page created or courses
  #          fetched, but publications will be loaded as intended.
  # This whitelist is the base of any blacklists, meaning this list is applied first.

  # The publication database does not necessarily use the same names as TISS.
  # In order to link names with the user profiles, names must be transformed to the correct name identifier
  # TO represents the value all FROM values must be mapped to
  # Example:
  # - to: Max Mustermann
  #      from:
  #        - Maximilian Mustermann
  #        - M. Mustermann
  # This setup will map all names matching either "Maximilian Mustermann" or "M. Mustermann" to "Max Mustermann"
  # WARNING: ALL NAMES THAT CONTAIN NON ASCII LETTERS MUST PROVIDE TRANSFORM RECORDS REMOVING THEM
