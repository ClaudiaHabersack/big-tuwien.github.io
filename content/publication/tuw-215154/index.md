abstract: Agile Software Development is being put to the industrial reality test.
  Lean Development, also known as Just-in-Time Production, has made its way into software
  engineering in recent years. This article gives an overview of similarities and
  differences of agile follower Scrum and lean follower Kanban and presents a concept
  for a hybrid of the two methodologies. By taking elements from both processes, strengths
  can be combined and weaknesses reduced. A case study provides first impressions
  of the concept´s practical realization.
