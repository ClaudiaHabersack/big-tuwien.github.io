abstract: With the introduction of NFC-equipped mobile phones real-world  tagging
  technologies have become available to a wide audience. It  is therefore time to
  investigate the usability of the mobile touch  interaction paradigm in real contexts
  to ensure its acceptance  among users. In this paper we discuss usability issues
  of mobile  touch interactions regarding the user interface, user interactions,  and
  the user experience. We further present results from a study  on NFC interaction
  and a prototype to leverage the accessibility of  real-world tagging technologies.
