abstract: In this paper we suggest the ceiling as a new  physical surface for information
  visualization. To  provide a design framework for application designers,  we present
  the notion of `information skyÂ´. This concept  is based on (1) the metaphor of the
  natural sky, (2)  historical examples of ceiling art and (3) recent  computing paradigms,
  including mediatecture,  ubiquitous computing and ambient display. We further  introduce
  three distinct categories that denote potential  application domains for ceiling-based
  data  visualizations. Finally, we present four different  application scenarios
  we have developed using  prototyping and user-centered design techniques, and  discuss
  how they relate to the categories.
